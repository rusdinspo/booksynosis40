Is that true?&#39; In December 1807, Alexander I granted a commission to Nadezhda Durova who, in male guide, served nearly ten years in the Russian light cavalry during the Napoleonic wars. The Cavalry Maiden, a selection of the edited journals of her military service, first published in 1836 with Pushkin&#39;s encouragement, is a lively narrative Russian life on and off the battlefield in the Alexandrine era.</p><h2>Caves of Missouri</h2><p><p>In this reprint of a classic piece of cave literature, the famed geologist, J Harlen Bretz, gives a detailed account of the formation and history of Missouri caves. Caves of Missouri contains over 450 surveyed caves, with in-depth geological and cultural histories, and 168 illustrations, including cross sections, maps, and photographs. This book is an excellent resource for anyone interested in Missouri's natural and cultural history.</p><strong>Selected Text from the Introduction</strong><p>The caves of Missouri are many and varied. No one will ever know how many caves Missouri has, nor is it possible that everyone will ever agree on a definition of a cave. Is a rock shelter, broad along the hillside but shallow in penetration of the hill a cave? Is a natural bridge a cave? Is a hole that can barely be crawled into for only a few feet a cave? Is it a cave if one&#x2019;s light shows an opening into which he cannot force his way? Is it a cave if a former cavity has become completely filled with mud or broken rock? Even if we should rule out such cavities in limestone or dolomite, the State still has hundreds of underground openings into which one may penetrate beyond the reach of daylight. In terms of human experience, we generally think of a cave as being a natural roofed cavity in rock which may be penetrated for an appreciable distance by a human.</p><p>Before this study was undertaken, the Missouri Geological Survey had already compiled a list which contained the names and locations of 210 caves distributed among 40 counties. This list, with much information about a number of the caves, was made during the spare time of Willard Farrar, the Survey&#x2019;s cave enthusiast. Many of the caves were visited by him personally and printed sources were searched for information. Statements from his manuscript which appear in this publication are identified by his name in parentheses. The list has now grown to include 437 caves in 55 counties. In this work, 250 of these caves have some description and 133 were investigated by the writer.</p><p>By far the largest number of Missouri caves are located in the southern half of the State, which is generally referred to as the Ozark plateau or dome. Almost all of the State is underlain by limestone and dolomite formations in which ground water dissolves out caves. Thus, the area north of the Missouri River may well contain as large a proportion of caves as do the Ozarks, but the cover of glacial drift and the lack of deep stream valleys north of the river conspire to keep us ignorant of their existence.</p><p>Most of Missouri&#x2019;s caves have had some attention from venturous individuals. Ask almost any old-timer in the Ozarks about wild caves in his region, and his answer usually will be, &#x201c;When I was a boy, I explored back into&#x2014;&#x201d;. It has not been feasible for the Survey to collect information on all the small, distant, or difficult caves. The guiding principle of this study has been to examine those that promised good returns without undue expenditure of time. The returns most desired were something more than locations, dimensions, and descriptions. A reading from Nature&#x2019;s record of the history of each cave has been sought. Only from that can we obtain an understanding of the changing geological conditions which have given us the caves of Missouri.</p><p>A point stressed in the history of almost every cave is that it is older than the latest broad uparching of the Ozark dome. That regional uplift was responsible for the subsequent stream erosion which has today exposed the cavities that were made before the latest doming occurred.</p></p><p>J Harlen Bretz (1882 - 1981) was an American geologist and professor at the University of Chicago. Bretz was best known for his revolutionary ideas about the origins of the Channeled Scablands of eastern Washington. His ideas, though eventually proven correct, contradicted the prevailing theory of the day. He was also an authority on caves and cave formation, authoring several works on caves.</p><h2>Original Thinking: A Radical Revisioning of Time, Humanity, and Nature</h2><p>In&nbsp;<i>Original Thinking,</i>&nbsp;Glenn Aparicio Parry delves into the evolution of Western thought to recover the living roots of wisdom that can correct the imbalances in our modern worldview. Inspired by groundbreaking dialogues that the author organized between Native American elders and leading-edge Western scientists to explore the underlying principles of the cosmos, this book offers a radical revisioning of how we think. Asking questions such as, Is it possible to come up with an original thought?, What does it mean to be human?, and How has our thinking created our world today?, Parry challenges us to consider many of our most basic assumptions. To think originally--as in thinking new thoughts that have never been thought or said before--is according to Parry, largely an illusion. So, too, is the idea of linear human progress. Most of us have traveled far from our ancestral lands, and in so doing, lost connection with place, the origin of our consciousness.<br><br><i>Original Thinking&nbsp;</i>offers a radical revisioning of how we think and what it means to be human. It invites us to reintegrate our hearts with our heads and to expand our self-imposed narrowing of consciousness. In doing so we reconnect with the living, original source--nature and her interconnected elements and cycles--and embrace the communion of old and new, rational and intuitive, and masculine and feminine. Ultimately, Parry shows us how to create the tapestry of truly original thinking and to restore thought as a blessing, as a whole and complete transmission from Spirit.<br><br>Contents<br>PART ONE (ORIGIN): Is it possible to come up with an original thought?<br>Chapter 1.

The founder and past president of the SEED Institute, Parry is currently the president of the think tank The Circle for Original Thinking. He earned his BA in Psychology from Allegheny College and went on to earn both his MA in East-West Psychology and his PhD in Humanities with a concentration in Transformative Learning from the California Institute of Integral Studies.&nbsp;Parry organized and participated in the groundbreaking Language of Spirit Conferences from 1999-2011 that brought together Native and Western scientists in dialogue, moderated by Leroy Little Bear. He is a member of the Institute of Noetic Sciences and the Theosophical Society as part of a lifelong interest in bridging the arts and sciences. An avid outdoorsman, he now makes his home in the foothills of the Sandia Mountains in Albuquerque, New Mexico, with his wife Tomoko, dog Sunrise, and cat Haru (Japanese for spring)."[Parry] talks to readers about slowing the thought process, about the vibrational web of thought where the past never completely disappears, and about the mysterious power which was contained in the thoughts of ancient time. He asks us to consider the consequences of our perception of time and the idea of separateness. He suggests that stress is a healthy part of life and that thinking in circles is more constructive than thinking in straight lines. This might sound like very heavy reading, but please know that Parry writes about these complex ideas with the creativity he is encouraging us to seek out in our own lives." &#x2014;ANNA JEDRZIEWSKI, <i>Retailing Insight</i><br><br>"Packed with deep truths and timeless wisdom."&#x2014;Gregg Braden, author of <i>Deep Truth</i><br><br>&#x201c;Parry&#x2019;s book is perhaps the bravest and the most effective means to reeducate ourselves to the luminous life of the undivided consciousness. If widely read, this potent work can have the most profound consequences in restoring us to the soul of the world and the world of soulful, natural living.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jean Houston, author of <i>A Passion for the Possible</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;One of the more upfront, truthful accounts I have read.

David Peat, author of <i>Blackfoot Physics</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Parry reminds us humans that it is within our capacity to recover our relationship with Nature and all her Beings.

[This] is even more than a prescription for restoring the world....

Asking the most basic questions, Parry challenges us to set aside conventional thinking and ponder life&#x2019;s firsts as blessings for which to be thankful&#x2014;the first thought, the first awareness, the first consciousness, the beginning of the cosmos&#x2014;in order to reeducate our minds, become one with nature as a state of being, and achieve wholeness through Spirit as our source.&#x201d;&#x2014;Phillip H. Duran (Tigua) author of <i>The Condor and the Eagle</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Read this book and be liberated from the selfish, greedy, egotistic, and separatist thinking that is currently dominating and destroying our planet. Learn how to return to the origin of thought which brings us back into synchronization&nbsp;with Nature. It isn&#x2019;t hard. Parry&nbsp;provides excellent instructions.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Carole Hart, producer and director of <i>For the Next Seven Generations: 13 Indigenous Grandmothers Weaving a World that Works</i> <br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;A brave and bold book that draws upon the power of ancient wisdom, ways of being in the world still rooted to a vibrant sense of the &#x2018;whole&#x2019;&#x2014;the whole of nature, the whole of humanity, the whole of time. Here is a book that we actually <i>need</i> to read, for our sake and the sake of life on this planet. For those willing to risk thinking their way toward viable and necessary alternatives to the dominant pressures of globalized capitalism, for those aware of the drastic consequences of our ignorance of the spiritual in favor of a selfish materialism, this book is not simply a treasure. It may be the one guide we need to begin to sort out how we might yet save ourselves.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mark S. Burrows, coauthor of <i>Minding the Spirit</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>&#x201c;Original Thinking</i> has to do with the movement between civilizations, between cultures, between languages, between worlds.&nbsp;It has to do with overcoming boundaries, crossing borders not only geographically&#x2014;but also psychologically and spiritually&#x2014;in communication, in thinking, and in identity.&nbsp;It means that one is never finished, that one is always journeying onward.&nbsp;That one is always ready for the next experience.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mona Polacca, (Havasupai/Hopi/Tewa), member of International Council of Thirteen Indigenous Grandmothers<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;There is a lot of rich terrain to explore in the &#x2018;third space&#x2019; opened by the decade-long dialogue between indigenous elders and scientists that inspired this work. As one of the long-time participants who was personally transformed, I am delighted by how the book distills some of the wisdom and burning questions that were forged in our historic dialogues. And I am even more heartened by Parry's ability to translate that wisdom into practical solutions and actions.&#x201d;&#x2014;Matthew C. Bronson, PhD, coeditor of <i>So What? Now What? The Anthropology of Consciousness Responds to a World in Crisis</i><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Reading <i>Original Thinking</i> felt like being stirred and mixed and rocked in a cradle between my left brain and my right brain. And I do suspect that there was an interconnecting subtle&nbsp;weaving process stitching together an even more supple fabric within my whole brain. And that this fabric that re-wove me into it re-wove me into the original memory of Wholeness of all of Creation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Victoria Hanchin, author of <i>The Seer and The Sayer</i><br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Letters from Tove</h2><p><b>A virtual memoir in letters by the beloved creator of the Moomins</b><br><br> Tove Jansson&#x2019;s works, even her famed Moomin books, fairly teem with letters of one kind or another, from messages bobbing in bottles to whole epistolary novels. Fortunately for her countless readers, her life was no different, unfolding as it did in the letters to family, friends, and lovers that make up this volume, a veritable autobiography over the course of six decades&#x2014;and the only one Jansson ever wrote. And just as letters carry a weight of significance in Jansson&#x2019;s writing, those she wrote throughout her life reflect the gravity of her circumstances, the depth of her thoughts and feelings, and the critical moments of humor, sadness, and grace that mark an artist&#x2019;s days.<br>These letters, penned with characteristic insight and wit, provide an almost seamless commentary on Jansson&#x2019;s life within Helsinki&#x2019;s bohemian circles and on her island home. Shifting between hope and despair, yearning and happiness, they describe her immersion in art studies and her ascension to fame with the Moomins. They speak frankly of friendship and love, loneliness and solidarity, and also of politics, art, literature, and society. They summon a particular place and time reflected through a mind finely attuned to her culture, her world, and her own nature&#x2014;all clearly put into biographical and historical context by the volume&#x2019;s editors, both longtime friends of Tove Jansson&#x2014;and, in the end, draw a complex, intimate self-portrait of one of the world&#x2019;s most beloved authors.<br><br></p><p>Finnish writer, artist, and political cartoonist Tove Jansson (1914&#x2013;2001) is best known for her books about the Moomins, adventurous, amusing cartoon trolls who had much in common with their bohemian, nature-loving author and, it seems, shared many of her family&#x2019;s traits.

"I think Little Hap just went looking for a place to hide."<br><br>"I thought he just came out of hiding," she said, and winked at me.<br><br>Thing was, she actually <i>had</i> pistol-whipped a midget. I was there. She was trying to find her daughter and save her life, but still, it was ugly, and I was a party to it. I will say this, however, in favor of the midget: he took his beating with stoic pride and refused to take it while wearing his cowboy hat, an expensive Stetson. He wanted it right on the skull and that's where he got it.<br><br>"You know, I think they prefer being called <i>dwarf</i> instead of <i>midget</i>, or<i> Little People</i>," I said.<br><br>"No kidding.

My best friend, Leonard Pine, and an ex-cop buddy, Marvin Hanson.<br><br>I opened the door.<br><br>"Sure isn't good to see you," I said to Leonard.<br><br>Leonard pushed on in. He was decked out in cowboy boots, jeans, a faded snap-pocket shirt that was a little stretched across his broad shoulders, and a shit-eating grin. "Now that's no way to be," he said.<br><br>"Your timing as usual is impeccable, brother," I said.<br><br>"Thank you."<br><br>"Leave your horse and hat at the corral?"<br><br>"The horse is wearing the hat," Leonard said.

"This guy, you can't get him to do nothing fun. His idea of a good time is chewing gum with a fruity flavor."<br><br>"Where's the love of your life?" I asked Leonard.<br><br>"John?"<br><br>"No. Winston Churchill."<br><br>"He's mad at me."<br><br>"Imagine that."<br><br>"It's nothing much. I think we called each other bitches and then I got mad enough to take a dump in the middle of the bed, and did."<br><br>"Overshare," I said.<br><br>"We both forget what started it, and we're both holding out for an apology. I will, of course, cave, and then we'll be back to normal. You got anything to eat?"<br><br>"I thought you ate tacos?"<br><br>"Two, maybe three hours ago."<br><br>"I'm not feeling all that friendly right now," I said. "Why would I want to feed you?"<br><br>"Interrupt something?" Leonard said, sliding into the kitchen to open the refrigerator.<br><br>"Yeah, me and Brett were just setting up the checkerboard. Marvin, why do you hang with this riffraff?"<br><br>Marvin found a soft chair and was sitting there, stretching out his leg, rubbing his knee. "I hang with him because I pity him."<br><br>"So why let him bother me?"<br><br>"Leonard said you love late-night company."<br><br>"He's a lying sonofabitch."<br><br>"Hey, boys," Brett said.<br><br>I turned and saw her coming down the stairs. She had on a white shorty robe and her hair was bed fluffed and her legs were long enough to make a giraffe drown himself. Her eyes were half closed and she was beautiful.<br><br>Leonard came back into the living room, empty-handed.<br><br>Brett finished off the stairs, said, "Hi, Leonard."<br><br>"Hi, Brett. You got anything to eat?"<br><br>"John lets you out to play this late?" she said.<br><br>"I'll make it up to him tomorrow," Leonard said. "I've got some moves, honey. If you like, I could show Hap some of my tricks, though it would be purely theoretical, of course."<br><br>"Your biology sucks," I said. "John. Brett. Different plumbing. Wouldn't work."<br><br>"Hi, Marvin," she said.<br><br>Marvin smiled, gave her a little wave.<br><br>"I'm having milk and cookies," she said. "Anyone else?"<br><br>"Me. Me," Leonard said. "Are the cookies by any chance... vanilla?"<br><br>"They are," Brett said. "Hap keeps them just for you, baby. There's also your favorite. Dr Peppers. These are from the only plant where the original formula is used. We drove over there special to get them."<br><br>"We were passing by the plant," I said, "so I thought, why not."<br><br>Leonard looked at me and batted his eyes. "You are the sweetest bastard ever squatted to crap over a pair of shoes."<br><br>"Cookies aren't just for you," I said. "I like them too. And Dr Pepper."<br><br>"He's a liar," Brett said. "He keeps them for you. He drinks that diet crap. Go sit down. Milk or Dr Pepper with your cookies?"<br><br>"Need you ask?" Leonard said.<br><br>"Marvin?" Brett said. "How about you?"<br><br>"Milk and cookies sounds fine."<br><br>"Great," she said. "Hap, get your ass in there and get the cookies. Some for me too. Chop-chop."<br><br>I started toward the kitchen. As I passed her, she grabbed my arm. "Just kidding," she said. "I'll get them. I was just evaluating your training. You get an A. Later I'll give you a treat, and it won't be a dog biscuit."<br><br>She leaned forward and kissed me on the lips.<br><br>As I started back into the living room area Leonard said, "Good dog. Next you'll be off the newspapers and using the yard."<br><br>"That's my goal."<br><br>I sat down on the couch, the far end from Leonard, who had kicked off his shoes and was stretching his legs out.<br><br>"I can't see what Brett sees in you, Hap," Leonard said.<br><br>"It's the parts you don't see," I said.<br><br>"Nor do I want to."<br><br>"I'm thinking, maybe," I said, "you didn't really come over here to interrupt my sex life and have milk and cookies."<br><br>"I'm having Dr Pepper," Leonard said. "Dr Pepper that you got special just for me."<br><br>"Go to hell, Leonard."<br><br>"You're right, Hap," Marvin said. "We didn't come over to have milk and cookies. It's a little more complicated than that."<br>3<br><br>We finished up our milk and cookies, Leonard his Dr Pepper and cookies, then Brett went upstairs to bed. The treat she offered me would have to be held in abeyance. I considered the delay Leonard's fault, and gave him a black mark on my mental chalkboard. No star for you, asshole. Next time I'd get RC instead of Dr Pepper, see how that pulled his chain, maybe get some of those nasty coconut cookies he hated. I hated them too, but the punishment was worth consideration.<br><br>We went out in the yard to talk so Brett wouldn't be bothered by our big mouths. She had bought some metal lawn chairs and put them out there, and I kept expecting to come out some morning and find they'd been chair-napped, as our part of the neighborhood was getting bad. Used to, you could leave your wallet on the porch swing and no one would bother it. These days, you left a cheese grater out, someone would steal the holes.<br><br>It was a nice night and there weren't too many lights on our street, and the sky was clear so you could look up through the limbs of the elm tree at the edge of the yard and see stars. It was too cool for crickets and there wasn't any traffic on the road out front. The air smelled fresh and a little sweet, like a baby's breath, and in that moment I was glad we lived there in that house with that yard and that big elm, in what the old books about the South used to call genteel poverty.<br><br>After seating ourselves in the lawn chairs, I crossed my legs and dangled a bunny shoe.<br><br>Leonard said, "Man, you could have at least put on pants. That robe is a little too peekaboo."<br><br>"My motto," I said, "is if you've got it, flaunt it."<br><br>"What you're flauntin' is enough to make a man turn a gun on himself," Leonard said.<br><br>Marvin said, "I got a job proposition to discuss."<br><br>"You're gonna love this, Hap," Leonard said.<br><br>I looked at Marvin. "Am I?"<br><br>"I don't think you're going to throw a parade, but here it is," Marvin said. "My daughter's daughter, her boyfriend, he's been beating on her."<br><br>This fit in with the theme Brett and I had been discussing. Maybe I should just send her over there with a shovel. If there was a dwarf, I could send her with a pistol.<br><br>I said, "Boyfriend? Your granddaughter? What is she, like twelve?"<br><br>"Eighteen."<br><br>"Get out," I said.<br><br>"They grow fast," he said.<br><br>"And she's a cutie," Leonard said. "You should see her. A dirty old hetero man like you, you'd love her."<br><br>"You've seen her?"<br><br>"Photograph," Leonard said.<br><br>I turned to Marvin. "So what exactly is the deal?"<br><br>"Well, he whipped up on her and I went over and caught him pulling into his place and he got out and I beat him a little bit with my cane. It wore me out and it didn't do my cane any good and I scuffed up a good pair of shoes. I had to get a new cane and have the shoes shined. That ain't a quarter no more. White boys are doing it now, by the way. They like at least five dollars."<br><br>"Inflation," Leonard said.<br><br>"How old is the boyfriend?" I asked.<br><br>"Twenty-five or so," Marvin said. "I don't know exactly. Old enough to be a better person than he is. Old enough for me to kill him and drop his body in a hole somewhere."<br><br>"So you beat him with your cane, and now you want... what?" I said. "Sounds like to me you took care of the problem, gave him an attitude adjustment. Did you leave the old cane up his ass and you want us to fetch it?"<br><br>"Deal is," Marvin said, "he didn't like it much, that beating, and he has friends he can go to. And my leg, it's just getting good, but it's not that good. I can whip one ass easy enough, but multiple asses, not so sure. And I'm only up for one ass at a time, maybe once a week during certain hours after lunch and well before sunset when the stars are aligned just right... I was lucky I caught him alone, without his posse."<br><br>"Call me foolish," I said, "but since you used to be a cop, did it occur to you that you might want to call the law and maybe have them go over there and do the domestic violence thing?"<br><br>"Therein lays the Shakespearean rub," Marvin said.<br><br>"That sounds like something I'd like on my middle leg," Leonard said.<br><br>"You see, my granddaughter, Julia, we call her Gadget, this guy she's with, he's kind of a drug dealer."<br><br>"Kind of?" I asked.<br><br>"Okay," Marvin said. "Absolutely he is. And if the law gets involved, well, she could get involved."<br><br>"I'm not loving this at all, Leonard."<br><br>"I was being facetious."<br><br>I turned to Marvin. Fearing I already knew the answer, I asked, "Why would she get involved if the law got involved?"<br><br>"Because she is selling grass out of their trailer, and they, as I said, are drug dealers. As for the law, they are in the drug dealer's pocket, in there with the lint and the pocket change. So it could really turn out bad."<br><br>"I probably should know this already," I said, "but what about Gadget's father? Maybe he can do something."<br><br>Marvin shook his head. "No reason you should know. I don't make a point of talking about him much. He ran off when she was a fetus, and now her mother is at her wits' end."<br><br>"So what you need from us is... ?" I asked.<br><br>"I need someone to do some serious ass whipping, and bring her home. If you can get by without the ass whipping and just bring her home, that'll do. But I'd like to think there will be an ass whipping. Not meaning her ass, of course."<br><br>"What if she doesn't want to come home?"<br><br>"I think she will. I think she would have the other day, but at the last minute she didn't. I'm not up to snuff. I burned myself out and didn't have any energy left, so I had to let her go. There wasn't anything I could do. I bluffed my way out to the car and got out of there. But you two, you can do it. You can bring her home."<br><br>I studied on this a moment, looked at Leonard. He gave me a small nod. I said, "We'll do it, but she doesn't want to come home, I don't know what to tell you. That's the case, we bring her back, she'll just run off again."</p><h2>Raw Juices Can Save Your Life: An A-Z Guide to Juicing.</h2><p>Promoting the health benefits of raw juice ingestion, this informative manual illustrates the powerful healing and rejuvenating properties of the essence of fruits and vegetables.

In spite of his preeminent stature, this is the first edition of Po Ch�?-i's poetry to appear in the West. It encompasses the full range of his work, from the early poems of social protest to the later recluse poems, whose spiritual depths reflect both his life-long devotion to Taoist and Ch'an (Zen) Buddhist practice. David Hinton's translations of ancient Chinese poetry have earned wide acclaim for creating compelling English texts that have altered our conception of Chinese poetry. Among his books published by New Directions are <em>The Selected Poems of Tu Fu</em>, and <em>The Selected Poems of Li Po</em>. His work has been supported by fellowships from The National Endowment for the Arts and The National Endowment for the Humanities.</p><p><p><strong>Po Ch�-i&nbsp;</strong>occupied several important government posts. He wrote over 3,000 poems&#x2015;brief, topical verses expressed in very simple, clear language. His poetry figures prominently in&nbsp;<em>The Tale of Genji</em>, the tenth century Japanese novel by Murasaki Shikibu. Po&#x2019;s work gained wide popularity throughout East Asia. He continued to write despite partial paralysis and enjoyed great fame during his lifetime.</p><p><strong>DAVID HINTON</strong>&#x2019;s original <em>Selected Poems of Tu Fu</em> was the first full-length verse translation of Tu Fu published in America. The author also of singular books of essays and poetry, Hinton has been awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, numerous N.E.A. and N.E.H fellowships, both major awards given for poetry translation in the United States, and a lifetime achievement award by The American Academy of Arts and Letters.</p>After Lunch<br> After Quiet Joys At South Garden, Which P'ei Tu Sent<br> After The Rebellion, At Liu-kou Monastery<br> All The Mountain Guests Started Up Incense-burner Peak Together,<br> Another Poem For The Wall Of My Thatch Hut<br> Asking The Rock That Holds Up My Ch'in<br> At Flowering-brightness Monastery In Yung-ch'ung District<br> At Home Giving Up Home<br> At The Pond, A Farewell<br> At The Pond, An Idle Chant<br> At Western-clarity Monastery In The Season Of Blooming Peonies<br> Autumn Butterflies<br> Autumn Pool<br> Autumn Rain, A Night Of Sleep<br> Autumn Thoughts, Sent Far Away<br> Bamboo Mountain's Eastern Pond<br> Beside The Pond, Under Bamboo<br> Blossoms For A Monk's Courtyard<br> Boundless And Free<br> Ch'in<br> A Ch'in At Night<br> Ch'in Song In Clear Night<br> Climbing Among Ancient Tombs East Of The Village<br> Climbing Mountains In Dream<br> Cold Night<br> Cold Night In The Courtyard<br> Cold Pavilion: An Invitation<br> Cool Autumn, Idle Dozing<br> Dreaming Of Long Ago<br> Dwelling In Idleness<br> Early Autumn<br> Early Cicadas<br> Early Cicadas<br> Early Morning, Combing My Hair Out<br> Early Morning, Taking Cloud-mother Powder<br> Early Spring<br> East Tower Bamboo<br> Enjoying Pine And Bamboo<br> Evening Rain<br> Eyes Going Dark<br> Facing Rocks I Placed In Yi-chu Stream To Break Up The Current Near<br> Facing Wine<br> Facing Wine On A Winter's Night, Sent To Huang-fu Shih<br> Farewell To My Day Lilies And Cassia<br> Farewell To The Recluse Wang<br> Figures For A Monk<br> First Month, Third Day: An Idle Stroll<br> Floodwaters<br> Flower No Flower<br> For The Beach Gulls<br> Forty-five<br> Foxglove Farmers<br> The Grain Tax<br> Grown-old Song, Sent To Liu Yu-hsi<br> A Guest Doesn't Come<br> Hard Times<br> Home Ground<br> Hsiang-yang Travels, Thinking Of Meng Hao-jan<br> Idle Night<br> Idle Song<br> Idle Song<br> Idle Song<br> In Answer To A Letter Sent By Liu Yu-hsi On An Autumn Day<br> In Reply To Autumn Night, No Sleep, Sent By Liu Yu-hsi<br> In Sickness, Mourning Golden-bells<br> In The Mountains<br> In The Mountains, Asking The Moon<br> Inviting Liu Shih-chiu<br> Late Autumn, Dwelling In Idleness<br> A Late-night Farewell To Meng Kung-ts'ao<br> Li The Mountain Recluse Stays The Night On Our Boat<br> Living Idly In The Hsin-ch'ang District, I Invite Yang-ju-shih's<br> Long Lines Sent To Ling Hu-ch'u Before He Comes To Visit My Tumbledown<br> Lu-tao District, Dwelling In Spring<br> Meeting An Old Friend<br> Mourning A-ts'ui<br> Mourning Peach Blossoms In The Palace Gardens At Night, I Think Of<br> My First Visit To Incense-mountain Monastery, Facing The Moon<br> My Old Home<br> My Thatch Hut Newly Built Below Incense-burner Peak, I Chant My<br> My Thatched Mountain Hut Just Finished Ch'i-sited Below Incense-burner<br> New Year's Eve<br> New Yueh-fu: 22.

All of this is enriched by Paz&#x2019;s gorgeous and vibrantly colored photographs and by short narratives about significant aspects of Israel&#x2019;s diverse cuisine, such as the generous and unique Israeli breakfast (which grew out of the needs of Kibbutz life), locally produced cheeses that now rival those of Europe, and a dramatic renaissance of wine culture in this ancient land.<br><br>&#x201c;In less than thirty years,&#x201d; Janna Gur writes, &#x201c;Israeli society has graduated... to a true gastronomic haven.&#x201d; Here she gives us a book that does full, delectable justice to the significance of Israeli food today&#x2013;Mediterranean at its heart, richly spiced, and imbued with cross-cultural flavors.</p><p>Janna Gur was born and raised in the former Soviet Union and immigrated to Israel in 1974.

The books represent the kind of learning experience I went through when I was Thaddeus&#39; age and learning how to patty-cake when it came to doing the right thing for clients.&#34; Today John Ellsworth lives in Arizona, is married with three grown children (all musicians and teachers) and rescues guinea pigs and plays classical guitar. &#34;My next novel is underway and looks like a breath-holding thriller, so please check back often.&#34;</p><h2>The HypoThyroid Diet: Lose Weight and Beat Fatigue in 21 Days</h2><p><p>Is hypothyroidism affecting your life, work, and family; are you a different person now than you were a few years ago?<br> "The Hypothyroid Diet" is a simple step-by-step system you could use to start eliminating your symptoms one by one.

Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Published in 1896, "The Damnation of Theron Ware or Illumination is a profound psychological portrait of the spiritual undoing of a guileless Methodist minister who is taken in by a rural townspeople's various progressive ideas, from liberalism to bohemianism, only to be spurned by them for being too conventional. Described by Everett Carter as "among the four or five best novels written by an American during the nineteenth century," the novel, as Joyce Carol Oates writes in her Introduction, has "shrewd, disturbing insights into the human pysche." <br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic is set from the text of the authoritative Harold Frederic Edition.&#x201c;[Frederic&#x2019;s] most brilliant achievement.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Edmund Wilson</b></p><h2>Whopper Cake</h2><p>Today is Grandma's birthday,<br> and Granddad has an ichin',<br> to bake a WHOPPER<br> chocolate cake<br> and traumatize the kitchen! <br> <br> Join the madcap frenzy of making the biggest cake in the world! And the biggest...mess!</p><p>Karma Wilson is the bestselling author of several picture books, including the Bear Books series,&nbsp;<i>Where Is Home, Little Pip?</i>, and&nbsp;<i>A Dog Named Doug</i>.&nbsp;Karma lives in Montana.On Grandma's birthday, she makes this pronouncement: Now listen up, / don't make a fuss, you hear? / Land sakes! I swear your cakes are / getting bigger every year. But Grandpa has an itchin' . . . to traumatize the kitchen&#x2014;and a vision too big to be contained by spousal directives, kitchen, pan, or oven. Writing in bouncy verses, the author of Bear Snores On (2003) and others chronicles the ensuing, supersize baking project as Grandpa swaps spoon for oar and blends his batter in a pickup truck. The story isn't as layered as its enormous, sun-baked dessert, but the tall-tale premise provides lots of grist for Hillenbrand's oversize paintings, which capture the messy, experimental energy of a baker gone berserk and cast everything in a decorator's sugary hues. A closing message about cleanup is well placed, especially given the impetus to traumatize the kitchen provided by the appended recipe&#x2014;for a normal-size chocolate cake, alas.

This definitive collection of beetle-themed designs offers instructions for using the 17th century art of raised stumpwork embroidery, the metallic threads of goldwork, and glittering beadwork to create lifelike designs. Hundreds of color and black-and-white illustrations will teach embroiderers all about the craft: tools and equipment needed, special beading techniques, creating dimensional designs with appliqu�, mounting their images, and more.<br></p><p>Jane Nicholas has worked in the field of embroidery for over twenty years, specialising in stumpwork and goldwork embroidery. She has written five books and has contributed widely to journals and magazines. She teaches widely for Embroiderers&#39; Guilds and businesses in Australia, New Zealand and the United States, and continues to research and develop new techniques, particularly in stumpwork.For anyone except a scientist, it is difficult at best to equate bugs and beetles with beauty. Yet for Australian needleworker Nicholas, this book is the culmination of a decades-long fascination with an insect that is more than 240 million years old. Using elegant illustrations, she details the anatomy first, then the various iterations of this many-legged bug, from its employment in jewelry to its collectability as part of a specimen box. Most impressive are the more than 70 patterns, including beetles executed in goldwork, applique, stump work, and surface embroidery--alone, in pairs, and posing with snails, pomegranates, crocus, clover, and a host of other natural beings. Perhaps the most charming? A series of beetle-shaped handbags, including a scarab pouch and a satin evening bag. At the end are very thorough explanations of stitches, techniques, and equipment; a bibliography and further reading; and stump-work suppliers and kit information. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

A loaded gun. Trouble with the possibility of rubble.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just need to get back to school, around all my friends.&#x201d;<br> <br>Whenever I quoted shrinks to her, Mom relaxed somewhat, as if it was proof that I&#x2019;d actually listened to them.<br> <br>I could remember a lot of what the docs said&#x2014;because they&#x2019;d made me forget so much of my life before the clinic.<br> <br>With her hands clasped behind her back, Mom began strolling around my room, her gaze flickering over my belongings&#x2014;a pretty, blond Sherlock Holmes sniffing for any secrets she didn&#x2019;t yet know.<br> <br>She&#x2019;d find nothing; I&#x2019;d already hidden my contraband in my book bag.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you have a nightmare last night?&#x201d;<br> <br>Had she heard me shoot upright with a cry? &#x201c;Nope.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;When you were catching up with your friends, did you confide to anyone where you really were?&#x201d;<br> <br>Mom and I had told everyone that I&#x2019;d gone to a special school for &#x201c;deportment.&#x201d; After all, you can&#x2019;t prep a daughter too early for those competitive sororities in the South.<br> <br>In reality, I&#x2019;d been locked up at the Children&#x2019;s Learning Center, a behavioral clinic for kids. Also known as Child&#x2019;s Last Chance.<br> <br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t told anyone about CLC,&#x201d; I said, horrified by the idea of my friends, or my boyfriend, finding out.<br> <br>Especially not him. Brandon Radcliffe. With his hazel eyes, movie-star grin, and curling light-brown hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. It&#x2019;s our business only.&#x201d; She paused before my room&#x2019;s big wall mural, tilting her head uneasily. Instead of a nice watercolor or a retro-funk design, I&#x2019;d painted an eerie landscape of tangled vines, looming oaks, and darkening skies descending over hills of cane. I knew she&#x2019;d considered painting over the mural but feared I&#x2019;d reach my limit and mutiny.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you taken your medicine this morning?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like I always do, Mom.&#x201d; Though I couldn&#x2019;t say my bitter little pills had done much for my nightmares, they did stave off the delusions that had plagued me last spring.<br> <br>Those terrifying hallucinations had been so lifelike, leaving me temporarily blinded to the world around me. I&#x2019;d barely completed my sophomore year, brazening out the visions, training myself to act like nothing was wrong.<br> <br>In one of those delusions, I&#x2019;d seen flames blazing across a night sky. Beneath the waves of fire, fleeing rats and serpents had roiled over Haven&#x2019;s front lawn, until the ground looked like it was rippling.<br> <br>In another, the sun had shone&#x2014;at night&#x2014;searing people&#x2019;s eyes till they ran with pus, mutating their bodies and rotting their brains. They became zombielike blood drinkers, with skin that looked like crinkled paper bags and oozed a rancid slime. I called them bogeymen.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>My short-term goal was simple: Don&#x2019;t get exiled back to CLC. My long-term goal was a bit more challenging: Survive the rest of high school so I could escape to college.<br> <br>&#x201c;And you and Brandon are still an item?&#x201d; Mom almost sounded disbelieving, as if she didn&#x2019;t understand why he would still be going out with me after my three-month absence.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be here soon,&#x201d; I said in an insistent tone. Now she&#x2019;d gotten me nervous.<br> <br>No, no. All summer, he&#x2019;d faithfully texted me, though I&#x2019;d only been allowed to respond twice a month. And ever since my return last week, he&#x2019;d been wonderful&#x2014;my cheerful, smiling boyfriend bringing me flowers and taking me to movies.<br> <br>&#x201c;I like Brandon. He&#x2019;s such a good boy.&#x201d; At last, Mom concluded this morning&#x2019;s interrogation. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re back, honey. It&#x2019;s been so quiet around Haven without you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Quiet? I yearned to say, &#x201c;Really, Karen? You know what&#x2019;s worse than quiet? Fluorescent bulbs crackling twenty-four hours a day in the center. Or maybe the sound of my cutter roommate weeping as she attacked her thigh with a spork? How about disconnected laughter with no punch line?&#x201d;<br> <br>But then, that last one had been me.<br> <br>In the end, I said nothing about the center. Just two years and out.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mom, I&#x2019;ve got a big day.&#x201d; I shouldered my backpack. &#x201c;And I want to be outside when Brand shows.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d already made him wait for me all summer.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, of course.&#x201d; She shadowed me down the grand staircase, our steps echoing in unison. At the door, she tucked my hair behind my ears and gave me a kiss on my forehead, as if I were a little girl. &#x201c;Your shampoo smells nice&#x2014;might have to borrow some.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d; I forced another smile, then walked outside. The foggy air was so still&#x2014;as if the earth had exhaled but forgotten to inhale once more.<br> <br>I descended the front steps, then turned to gaze at the imposing home I&#x2019;d missed so much.<br> <br>Haven House was a grand twenty-two-room mansion, fronted by twelve stately columns. Its colors&#x2014;wood siding of the lightest cream, hurricane shutters of the darkest forest green&#x2014;had remained unchanged since it&#x2019;d originally been built for my great-great-great-great-grandmother.<br> <br>Twelve massive oak trees encircled the structure, their sprawling limbs grown together in places, like hundred-ton hydras trapping prey.<br> <br>The locals thought Haven House looked haunted. Seeing the place bathed in fog, I had to admit that was fair.<br> <br>As I waited, I meandered across the front lawn to a nearby cane row, leaning in to smell a purple stalk. Crisp but sweet. One of the feathery green leaves was curled so that it looked like it was embracing my hand. That made me smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get rain soon,&#x201d; I murmured, hoping Sterling&#x2019;s drought would finally end.<br> <br>My smile deepened when I saw a sleek Porsche convertible speeding down our oystershell drive, a blur of red.<br> <br>Brandon. He was the most enviable catch in our parish. Senior. Quarterback. Rich. The trifecta of boyfriends.<br> <br>When he pulled up, I opened the passenger door with a grin. &#x201c;Hey, big guy.&#x201d;<br> <br>But he frowned. &#x201c;You look&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. tired.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t get to bed till late,&#x201d; I replied, darting a glance over my shoulder as I tossed my bag into the minuscule backseat. When the kitchen curtain fluttered to the side, I just stopped myself from rolling my eyes. Two years and out&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;You feeling okay?&#x201d; His gaze was filled with concern. &#x201c;We can pick up some coffee on the way.&#x201d;<br> <br>I shut the door behind me. &#x201c;Sure. Whatever.&#x201d; He hadn&#x2019;t complimented me on my hair or outfit&#x2014;my Chlo� baby-blue sleeveless dress with the hem no more than four regulation inches above the knee, the silky black ribbon that held my hair back in a curling ponytail, my matching black Miu Miu ankle-wrap heels.<br> <br>My diamond earrings and Patek Philippe wristwatch served as my only jewelry.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d spent weeks planning this outfit, two days in Atlanta acquiring it, and the last hour convincing myself I&#x2019;d never looked better.<br> <br>He hiked his wide shoulders, the matter forgotten, then peeled down Haven&#x2019;s drive, tires spitting up an arc of shell fragments as we zoomed past acre after acre of cane.<br> <br>Once we&#x2019;d reached the highway, a seamed and worn-out stretch of old Louisiana road, he said, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re so quiet this morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I had weird dreams last night.&#x201d; Nightmares. Nothing new there.<br> <br>Without fail, my good dreams were filled with plants. I&#x2019;d see ivy and roses growing before my eyes or crops sprouting all around me.<br> <br>But lately in my nightmares, a crazed redheaded woman with gleaming green eyes used those same plants to&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. hurt people, in grisly ways. When her victims begged for mercy, she would cackle with delight.<br> <br>She was cloaked and partially hooded, so I couldn&#x2019;t make out all of her face, but she had pale skin and green ivylike tattoos running down both her cheeks. Her wild red hair was strewn with leaves.<br> <br>I called her the red witch. &#x201c;Sorry,&#x201d; I said with a shiver. &#x201c;They kind of put me in a funk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh.&#x201d; His demeanor told me he felt way out of his depth. I&#x2019;d once asked him if he had nightmares, and he&#x2019;d looked at me blankly, unable to remember one.<br> <br>That was the thing about Brandon&#x2014;he was the most happy-go-lucky boy I&#x2019;d ever met. Though he was built like a bear&#x2014;or a pro football player&#x2014;his temperament was more adoring canine than grizzly.<br> <br>Secretly, I put a lot of store in him, hoping his normal could drag me back from my wasteland-visions brink. Which was why I&#x2019;d fretted about him finding another girl and breaking up with me while I was locked up at CLC.<br> <br>Now it seemed like at least one thing was going to work out. Brandon had stayed true to me. With every mile we drove away from Haven, the sun shone brighter and brighter, the fog lifting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, I know how to put my girl in a good mood.&#x201d; He gave me his mischievous grin.<br> <br>I was helpless not to be charmed. &#x201c;Oh, yeah, big guy? How&#x2019;s that?&#x201d;<br> <br>He pulled off the road under the shade of a pecan tree, tires popping the fallen pecans. After waiting for the dust to pass us, he pressed a button and put down the convertible top. &#x201c;How fast you wanna go, Eves?&#x201d;<br> <br>Few things exhilarated me more than flying down the highway with the top down. For about a nanosecond I considered how to repair the utter loss of my hairstyling&#x2014;braid a loose fishtail over your shoulder&#x2014;then told him, &#x201c;Kick her in the guts.&#x201d;<br> <br>He peeled out, the engine purring with power. Hands raised, I threw my head back and yelled, &#x201c;Faster!&#x201d;<br> <br>At each gear, he redlined before shifting, until the car stretched her legs. As houses whizzed past, I laughed with delight.<br> <br>The months before were a dim memory compared to this&#x2014;the sun, the wind, Brandon sliding me excited grins. He was right; this was just what I needed.<br> <br>Leave it to my teddy bear of a football player to make me feel carefree and sane again.<br> <br>And didn&#x2019;t that deserve a kiss?<br> <br>Unbuckling my seat belt, I clambered up on my knees, tugging my dress up a couple of inches so I could lean over to him. I pressed my lips against the smooth-shaven skin of his cheek. &#x201c;Just what the doctor ordered, Brand.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know it!&#x201d;<br> <br>I kissed his broad jaw, then&#x2014;as my experienced best friend Melissa had instructed&#x2014;I nuzzled his ear, letting him feel my breath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, Evie,&#x201d; he rasped. &#x201c;You drive me crazy, you know that?&#x201d;<br> <br>I was getting an idea. I knew I played with fire, teasing him like this. He&#x2019;d already been reminding me of a promise I&#x2019;d made right before I left for deportment school: If we were still going out when I turned sixteen (I was a young junior), I would play my V card. My birthday was next Monday&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;What the hell does that guy want?&#x201d; he suddenly exclaimed.<br> <br>I drew my head back from Brandon, saw he was glancing past me. I darted a look back, and my stomach plummeted.<br> <br>A guy on a motorcycle had pulled up right next to us, keeping pace with the car, checking me out. His helmet had a tinted visor so I couldn&#x2019;t see his face, but I knew he was staring at my ass.<br> <br>First instinct? Drop my butt in the seat, willing my body to disappear into the upholstery. Second instinct? Stay where I was and glare at the pervert. This was my morning, my laughter, my fast drive in my boyfriend&#x2019;s luxury sports car.<br> <br>After a summer spent in a fluorescent hell, I deserved this morning.<br> <br>When I twisted around to glare over my shoulder, I saw the guy&#x2019;s helmet had dipped, attention definitely on my ass. Then he slowly raised his head, as if he was raking his gaze over every inch of me.<br> <br>It felt like hours passed before he reached my eyes. I tugged my hair off my face, and we stared at each other for so long that I wondered when he was going to run off the road.<br> <br>Then he gave me a curt nod and sped past us, expertly dodging a pothole.

In <i>The Theology of Liberalism,</i> one of the country&#x2019;s most important political theorists argues that we could hardly be more wrong. Eric Nelson contends that the tradition of liberal political philosophy founded by John Rawls is, however unwittingly, the product of ancient theological debates about justice and evil. Once we understand this, he suggests, we can recognize the deep incoherence of various forms of liberal political philosophy that have emerged in Rawls&#x2019;s wake.</p><p>Nelson starts by noting that today&#x2019;s liberal political philosophers treat the unequal distribution of social and natural advantages as morally arbitrary. This arbitrariness, they claim, diminishes our moral responsibility for our actions. Some even argue that we are not morally responsible when our own choices and efforts produce inequalities. In defending such views, Nelson writes, modern liberals have implicitly taken up positions in an age-old debate about whether the nature of the created world is consistent with the justice of God. Strikingly, their commitments diverge sharply from those of their proto-liberal predecessors, who rejected the notion of moral arbitrariness in favor of what was called Pelagianism&#x2015;the view that beings created and judged by a just God must be capable of freedom and merit. Nelson reconstructs this earlier &#x201c;liberal&#x201d; position and shows that Rawls&#x2019;s philosophy derived from his self-conscious repudiation of Pelagianism. In closing, Nelson sketches a way out of the argumentative maze for liberals who wish to emerge with commitments to freedom and equality intact.</p></p><p>Eric Nelson is the Robert M. Beren Professor of Government at Harvard University. He is the author of <i>The Royalist Revolution: Monarchy and the American Founding</i>, <i>The Hebrew Republic: Jewish Sources and the Transformation of European Political Thought</i> (both from Harvard), and <i>The Greek Tradition in Republican Thought</i>.&#x201c;[One] of the best treatments imaginable of the context and meaning of Rawls&#x2019;s epoch-making book...Illuminating and original...Nelson also places Rawls in the theological tradition better than anyone so far...A great and rewarding book.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Samuel Moyn</b><b>, </b><b><i>Commonweal</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;An excellent work, magnificently well done and provocative in all the right ways.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher Brooke, University of Cambridge</b><br><br>&#x201c;Since the first publication of <i>A Theory of Justice</i> some critics have argued that John Rawls&#x2019;s liberalism rests on a commitment to a questionable view of the self. Eric Nelson now raises the stakes with a critique that interrogates liberal accounts of human agency not just metaphysically but theologically. Nelson&#x2019;s work is marked by a unique combination of erudite scholarship, lucidity, analytical forcefulness, and the willingness to question received views. He has developed an original case and argued it with great power. His book represents a challenge that cannot be ignored.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Rosen, Harvard University, author of <i>Dignity</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>The Theology of Liberalism</i> is a remarkable, original, and provocative book with stylish and engaging prose that offers a major intervention across several fields that are all too often artificially segregated: intellectual history, normative political theory, and theology.

In the darkness as I lay down to sleep, I see the Purbeck stone frontage in the glow of late afternoon. The sunlight glints off the upper windows, and the air is heavy with the scents of magnolia and salt. Ivy clings to the porch archway, and a magpie pecks at the lichen coating a limestone roof tile. Smoke seeps from one of the great chimneystacks, and the leaves on the unfelled lime avenue are May green and cast mottled patterns on the driveway. There are no weeds yet tearing through the lavender and thyme borders, and the lawn is velvet cropped and rolled in verdant stripes. No bullet holes pockmark the ancient garden wall and the drawing room windows are thrown open, the glass not shattered by shellfire. I see the house as it was then, on that first afternoon.</p><p>Everyone is just out of sight. I can hear the ring of the drinks tray being prepared; on the terrace a bowl of pink camellias rests on the table. And in the bay, the fishing boats bounce upon the tide, nets cast wide, the slap of water against wood. We have not yet been exiled. The cottages do not lie in pebbled ruins across the strand, with hazel and blackthorn growing through the flagstones of the village houses. We have not surrendered Tyneford to guns and tanks and birds and ghosts.</p><p>I find I forget more and more nowadays. Nothing very important, as yet. I was talking to somebody just now on the telephone, and as soon as I had replaced the receiver I realised I&#x2019;d forgotten who it was and what we said. I shall probably remember later when I&#x2019;m lying in the bath. I&#x2019;ve forgotten other things too: the names of the birds are no longer on the tip of my tongue and I&#x2019;m embarrassed to say that I can&#x2019;t remember where I planted the daffodil bulbs for spring. And yet, as the years wash everything else away, Tyneford remains&#x2014;a smooth pebble of a memory. Tyneford. Tyneford. As though if I say the name enough, I can go back again. Those summers were long and blue and hot. I remember it all, or think I do. It doesn&#x2019;t seem long ago to me. I have replayed each moment so often in my mind that I hear my own voice in every part. Now, as I write them, they appear fixed, absolute. On the page we live again, young and unknowing, everything yet to happen.</p><p>When I received the letter that brought me to Tyneford, I knew nothing about England, except that I wouldn&#x2019;t like it. That morning I perched on my usual spot beside the draining board in the kitchen as Hildegard bustled around, flour up to her elbows and one eyebrow snowy white. I laughed and she flicked her tea towel at me, knocking the crust out of my hand and onto the floor.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>Gut.</i> Bit less bread and butter won&#x2019;t do you any harm.&#x201d;</p><p>I scowled and flicked crumbs onto the linoleum. I wished I could be more like my mother, Anna. Worry had made Anna even thinner. Her eyes were huge against her pale skin, so that she looked more than ever like the operatic heroines she played. When she married my father, Anna was already a star&#x2014;a black-eyed beauty with a voice like cherries and chocolate. She was the real thing; when she opened her mouth and began to sing, time paused just a little and everyone listened, bathing in the sound, unsure if what they heard was real or some perfect imagining. When the trouble began, letters started to arrive from Venice and Paris, from tenors and conductors. There was even one from a double bass. They were all the same: <i>Darling Anna, leave Vienna and come to Paris/London/New York and I shall keep you safe . . .</i> Of course she would not leave without my father. Or me. Or Margot. I would have gone in a flash, packed my ball gowns (if I&#x2019;d had any) and escaped to sip champagne in the Champs Elys�es. But no letters came for me. Not even a note from a second violin. So I ate bread rolls with butter, while Hildegard sewed little pieces of elastic into my waistbands.</p><p>&#x201c;Come.&#x201d; Hildegard chivvied me off the counter and steered me into the middle of the kitchen, where a large book dusted with flour rested on the table. &#x201c;You must practise. What shall we make?&#x201d;</p><p>Anna had picked it up at a secondhand bookstore and presented it to me with a flush of pride. Mrs. Beeton&#x2019;s <i>Book of Household Management&#x2014;</i>a whole kilo of book to teach me how to cook and clean and behave. This was to be my unglamorous fate.</p><p>Chewing on my plait, I prodded the tome so that it fell open at the index. &#x201c;&#x2018;General Observations on Quadrupeds . . . Mock Turtle Soup . . . Eel Pie.&#x2019;&#x201d;I shuddered. &#x201c;Here.&#x201d; I pointed to an entry halfway down the page. &#x201c;Goose. I should know how to cook goose. I said I knew.&#x201d;</p><p>A month previously, Anna had walked with me to the telegraph offices so that I could wire a &#x201c;Refugee Advertisement&#x201d; to the London <i>Times</i>. I&#x2019;d dragged my feet along the pavement, kicking at the wet piles of blossoms littering the ground.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want to go to England. I&#x2019;ll come to America with you and Papa.&#x201d;</p><p>My parents hoped to escape to New York, where the Metropolitan Opera would help them with a visa, if only Anna would sing.</p><p>Anna picked up her pace. &#x201c;And you will come. But we cannot get an American visa for you now.&#x201d;</p><p>She stopped in the middle of the street and took my face in her hands. &#x201c;I promise you that before I even take a peek at the shoes in Bergdorf Goodmans, I will see a lawyer about bringing you to New York.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Before you see the shoes at Bergdorf&#x2019;s?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I promise.&#x201d;</p><p>Anna had tiny feet and a massive appetite for shoes. Music may have been her first love, but shoes were definitely her second. Her wardrobe was lined with row upon row of dainty high heels in pink, grey, patent leather, calfskin and suede. She made fun of herself to mollify me.</p><p>&#x201c;Please let me at least check your advertisement,&#x201d; Anna pleaded. Before she&#x2019;d met my father Anna had sung a season at Covent Garden and her English was almost perfect.</p><p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; I snatched the paper away from her. &#x201c;If my English is so terrible that I can only get a place at a flophouse, then it&#x2019;s my own fault.&#x201d;</p><p>Anna tried not to laugh. &#x201c;Darling, do you even know what a flophouse is?&#x201d;</p><p>Of course I had no idea, but I couldn&#x2019;t tell Anna that. I had visions of refugees like myself, alternately fainting upon overstuffed sofas. Full of indignation at her teasing, I made Anna wait outside the office while I sent the telegram:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b>VIENNESE JEWESS, 19, seeks position as domestic servant. Speaks fluid English. I will cook your goose. Elise Landau. Vienna 4, Dorotheegasse, 30/5.</b></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Hildegard fixed me with a hard stare. &#x201c;Elise Rosa Landau, I do not happen to have a goose in my larder this morning, so will you please select something else.&#x201d;</p><p>I was about to choose Parrot Pie, purely to infuriate Hildegard, when Anna and Julian entered the kitchen. He held out a letter. My father, Julian, was a tall man, standing six feet in his socks, with thick black hair with only a splash of grey around his temples, and eyes as blue as a summer sea. My parents proved that beautiful people don&#x2019;t necessarily produce beautiful children. My mother, with her fragile blond loveliness, and Julian so handsome that he always wore his wire-rimmed spectacles to lessen the effect of those too-blue eyes (I&#x2019;d tried them on when he was bathing, and discovered that the lenses were so weak as to be almost clear glass). Yet somehow this couple had produced me. For years the great-aunts had cooed, &#x201c;<i>Ach</i>, just you wait till she blossoms! Twelve years old, mark my words, and she&#x2019;ll be the spit of her mother.&#x201d; I could spit, but I was nothing like my mother. Twelve came and went. They held out for sixteen. Still no blossoming. By nineteen even Gabrielle, the most optimistic of the great-aunts, had given up hope. The best they could manage was: &#x201c;She has her own charm. And character.&#x201d; Whether this character was good or bad, they never said.</p><p>Anna lurked behind Julian, blinking and running a pink tongue-tip across her bottom lip. I stood up straight and concentrated on the letter in Julian&#x2019;s hand.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s from England,&#x201d; he said, holding it out to me.</p><p>I took it from him and with deliberate slowness, well aware they were all watching me, slid a butter knife under the seal. I drew out a creamy sheet of watermarked paper, unfolded it and smoothed the creases. I read in slow silence. The others bore with me for a minute and then Julian interrupted.</p><p>&#x201c;For God&#x2019;s sake, Elise. What does it say?&#x201d;</p><p>I fixed him with a glare. I glared a lot back then. He ignored me, and I read aloud.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Dear Fr�ulein Landau,</i></p><p><i>Mr. Rivers has instructed me to write to you and tell you that the position of house parlour maid at Tyneford House is yours if you want it.

On your arrival in London, proceed to the Mayfair Agency in Audley St. W1, where ongoing travel arrangements to Tyneford will be made.</i></p><p><i>Yours sincerely,</i></p><p><i>Florence Ellsworth</i></p><p><i>Housekeeper, Tyneford House</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I lowered the letter.</p><p>&#x201c;But twelve months is too long. I&#x2019;m to be in New York before then, Papa.&#x201d;</p><p>Julian and Anna exchanged a glance, and it was she who answered.</p><p>&#x201c;Darling Bean, I hope you will be in New York in six months. But for now, you must go where it is safe.&#x201d;</p><p>Julian tugged my plait in a gesture of playful affection. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t go to New York unless we know you&#x2019;re out of harm&#x2019;s way. The minute we arrive at the Metropolitan we&#x2019;ll send for you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I suppose it&#x2019;s too late for me to take singing lessons?&#x201d;</p><p>Anna only smiled. So it was true, then. I was to leave them. Until this moment it had not been real. I had written the telegram, even sent the wire to London, but it had seemed a game. I knew things were bad for us in Vienna. I heard the stories of old women being pulled out of shops by their hair and forced to scrub the pavements. Frau Goldschmidt had been made to scrape dog feces from the gutter with her mink stole. I overheard her confession to Anna; she had sat hunched on the sofa in the parlour, her porcelain cup clattering in her hands, as she confided her ordeal: &#x201c;The joke is, I never liked that fur. It was a gift from Herman, and I wore it to please him. It was much too hot and it was his mother&#x2019;s colour, not mine. He never would learn . . . But to spoil it like that . . .&#x201d; She&#x2019;d seemed more upset by the waste than the humiliation. Before she left, I saw Anna quietly stuff an arctic rabbit muffler inside her shopping bag.</p><p>The evidence of difficult times was all around our apartment. There were scratch marks on the floor in the large sitting room where Anna&#x2019;s baby grand used to sit. It was worth nearly two thousand schillings&#x2014;a gift from one of the conductors at La Scala. It had arrived one spring before Margot and I were born, but we all knew that Julian didn&#x2019;t like having this former lover&#x2019;s token cluttering up his home. It had been lifted up on a pulley through the dining room windows, the glass of which had to be specially removed&#x2014;how Margot and I used to wish that we&#x2019;d glimpsed the great flying piano spectacle. Occasionally, when Julian and Anna had one of their rare disagreements, he&#x2019;d mutter, &#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you have a box of love letters or a photograph album like any other woman? Why a bloody great grand piano? A man shouldn&#x2019;t have to stub his toe on his rival&#x2019;s passion.&#x201d; Anna, so gentle in nearly all things, was immovable on matters of music. She would fold her arms and stand up straight, reaching all of five feet nothing, and announce, &#x201c;Unless you wish to spend two thousand schillings on another piano and demolish the dining room again, it stays.&#x201d; And stay it did, until one day, when I arrived home from running a spurious errand for Anna to discover it missing. There were gouges all along the parquet floor, and from a neighbouring apartment I could hear the painful clatter of a talentless beginner learning to play. Anna had sold her beloved piano to a woman across the hall, for a fraction of its value. In the evenings at six o&#x2019;clock, we could hear the rattle of endless clumsy scales as our neighbour&#x2019;s acne-ridden son was forced to practise. I imagined the piano wanting to sing a lament at its ill treatment and pining for Anna&#x2019;s touch, but crippled into ugliness. Its rich, dark tones once mingled with Anna&#x2019;s voice like cream into coffee. After the banishment of the piano, at six every evening Anna always had a reason for leaving the apartment&#x2014;she&#x2019;d forgotten to buy potatoes (though the larder was packed with them), there was a letter to post, she&#x2019;d promised to dress Frau Finkelstein&#x2019;s corns.</p><p>Despite the vanished piano, the spoiled furs, the pictures missing from the walls, Margot&#x2019;s expulsion from the conservatoire on racial grounds and the slow disappearance of all the younger maids, so that only old Hildegard remained, until this moment I had never really thought that I would have to leave Vienna. I loved the city. She was as much a part of my family as Anna or great-aunts Gretta, Gerda and Gabrielle. It was true, strange things kept happening, but at age nineteen nothing really terrible had ever happened to me before and, blessed with the outlook of the soul-deep optimist, I had truly believed that all would be well. Standing in the kitchen as I looked up into Julian&#x2019;s face and met his sad half smile, I knew for the first time in my life that everything was not going to be all right, that things would not turn out for the best. I must leave Austria and Anna and the apartment on Dorotheegasse with its tall sash windows looking out onto the poplars that glowed pink fire as the sun crept up behind them and the grocer&#x2019;s boy who came every Tuesday yelling <i>&#x201c;Eis! Eis!&#x201d;</i> And the damask curtains in my bedroom that I never closed so I could see the yellow glow from the streetlamps and the twin lights from the tramcars below. I must leave the crimson tulips in the park in April, and the whirling white dresses at the Opera Ball, and the gloves clapping as Anna sang and Julian wiped away proud tears with his embroidered handkerchief, and midnight ice cream on the balcony on August nights, and Margot and I sunbathing on striped deckchairs in the park as we listened to trumpets on the bandstand, and Margot burning supper, and Robert laughing and saying it doesn&#x2019;t matter and us eating apples and toasted cheese instead, and Anna showing me how to put on silk stockings without tearing them by wearing kid gloves, and . . . and . . .</p><p>&#x201c;And sit, drink some water.&#x201d;</p><p>Anna thrust a glass in front of me while Julian slid a wooden chair behind me. Even Hildegard looked rattled.</p><p>&#x201c;You have to go,&#x201d; said Anna.</p><p>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I said, realising as I did so that my luxuriant and prolonged childhood ...</p></p><h2>The Mortal Storm</h2><p>A highly acclaimed anti-fascist novel, <i>The Mortal Storm</i> was Phyllis Bottome's dramatic warning against the warmongering, antisemitism, and misogyny of the Nazis.

Highlighting Bottome&#39;s prolific writing career and lifelong humanitarian activism, The Mortal Storm pits the developing political and feminist consciousness of Freya Roth against the Nazi machine that will destroy the fabric of her family and nation.Phyllis Forbes Dennis (31 May 1884 &#x2013; 22 August 1963) was a British novelist and short story writer who wrote under her birth name, Phyllis Bottome (&nbsp;/b&#x259;&#x2c8;to&#x28a;m/ b&#x259;-TOHM). She was born in Rochester, Kent to an American clergyman, Rev. William MacDonald Bottome and Mary (Leatham) Bottome. In 1917, in Paris, she married Alban Ernan Forbes Dennis, a British diplomat working firstly in Marseilles and then in Vienna as Passport Control Officer, a cover for his real role as MI6 Head of Station with responsibility for Austria, Hungary and Yugoslavia. Her marriage to Forbes Dennis was to be a long and triumphant partnership. Forbes Dennis died in July 1972 in Brighton. Bottome studied Individual psychology under Alfred Adler while in Vienna. This would become useful in her work both as a teacher and a writer.

On that day, led by a U.S.-trained General, the Honduran military barged in to the president&#x2019;s house and took him in his pajamas into a helicopter, flying him first to a U.S. base in Honduras and then on to Costa Rica. It was the first coup of the 21st century in Central America. The military and Honduran oligarchy quickly imposed an interim government, undid most of the progressive reforms underway, and passed hundreds of concessions to corporate interests. To the surprise of the coup&#x2019;s backers, however, thousands of people around the country spontaneously came out into the streets. Their numbers and the depth of their vision and commitment kept growing during hundreds of days of consecutive protest, with fearless women at the forefront. <p> Melissa calls those the times &#x201c;when protests were poetry in the streets.&#x201d; 13 Colors of the Honduran Resistance is her most intimate and impactful work to date. It is a book about the multiple and intersectional identities of those who found each other in the streets through the resistance. It is a book about what they share, not just with each other but with all people who struggle for a more just world. Melissa weaves the stories of 13 women together in a way that leaves readers unfamiliar with the events surrounding the coup and resistance in Honduras convinced of their fundamental importance to liberation struggles everywhere. </p><p> This bilingual edition is the product of collaboration with translator Matt Ginsberg-Jaeckle, who was introduced to the author by assassinated indigenous leader Berta C�ceres, to whom this edition is dedicated. </p><p> ---- En 13 Colores de la Resistencia Hondure�a, la luchadora feminista y autora Melissa Cardoza cuenta 13 historias de mujeres de la resistencia hondure�a despu�s del golpe de Estado del 28 de julio de 2009 en contra del Presidente Manuel Zelaya. Ese d�a, los militares hondure�os allanaron la casa del Presidente y lo llevaron en pijamas a un helic�ptero, pasando primero por una base militar de EE.UU. en Honduras y luego a Costa Rica. Dirigidos por el General Hondure�o Romeo V�squez Vel�squez, entrenado en la Escuela de las Am�ricas en EE.UU., llevaron a cabo el primer golpe de Estado del siglo veintiuno en Centroam�rica. Los militares y la oligarqu�a hondure�a r�pidamente impusieron un gobierno interino, deshicieron la mayor parte de las reformas progresivas que hab�an empezado y aprobaron cientos de concesiones para las empresas privadas. </p><p> Pero los golpistas fueron sorprendidos cuando miles de personas en todo el pa�s salieron espont�neamente a las calles. El n�mero de gente, as� como la profundidad de su visi�n y compromiso durante cientos de d�as de movilizaci�n consecutiva, continuaron creciendo con mujeres valientes siempre en las primeras filas. </p><p> Melissa describe esa etapa como los tiempos &#x201c;cuando las manifestaciones eran poes�a en las calles&#x201d;. 13 Colores de la Resistencia Hondure�a es su obra m�s �ntima e impactante hasta la fecha. Como sugiere el t�tulo, es un libro sobre las identidades plurales e interseccionales de quienes se encontraron en las calles por medio de la resistencia. Es un libro sobre lo que comparten, no solamente entre s�, sino con todos los pueblos que luchan por un mundo m�s justo. Melissa teje las historias de estas 13 mujeres juntas de tal forma que el lector o la lectora, sin conocimiento previo de los eventos del golpe de Estado y de la resistencia en Honduras, termina convencid@ de su importancia fundamental para las luchas de liberaci�n en todas partes. </p><p> Esta edici�n biling�e es producto de una colaboraci�n con traductor Matt Ginsberg-Jaeckle, quien conoci� a la autora a trav�s de la lideresa ind�gena asesinada Berta C�ceres, a quien esta edici�n est� dedicada.</p></p><p>Melissa Cardoza is a writer and feminist artist born in Honduras amidst the sexual rebelliousness of the 60&#x2019;s. She is of mixed Afro-descendent Gar�funa and indigenous Lenca heritage, and describes herself as a &#x201c;Gar�Lenca... in resistance to parties, husbands and states, a traveling and curious woman.&#x201d; Her mother died when she was very young and she grew up in a household of four men. She joined the feminist movement in her 20&#x2019;s while in college in Honduras in response to the killing of a young woman, a university student brutally murdered by two Honduran soldiers. She was attracted to the feminist movement for its rebelliousness, its creativity, its expressiveness, its independence. She left Honduras and lived in Mexico for two years where she joined a collective of other feminists and lesbians and wrote extensively. She came back, encountering a country in the throes of neoliberal economic reforms and burgeoning resistance against the wave of privatization and austerity that was sweeping not just Honduras but the rest of Latin America. <p> Though the feminist movement has always been her political home, she is also deeply immersed in the indigenous movement, largely because of her close friendship with Berta C�ceres, one of the principal leaders of the Lenca indigenous organization COPINH. In the aftermath of the coup d&#x2019;�tat and through the process of resistance against it she has been impacted by the diversity of forces and peoples in the streets, where she has been both documentarian and participant. She describes the vocation of the writer as someone always &#x201c;hunting stories in the reality around us.&#x201d; Her other work includes poetry, articles, short stories, essays and children&#x2019;s books. Previously, her mostly widely circulated publication was the children&#x2019;s book Tengo una t�a que no es monjita, or &#x201c;I have an aunt who is not a nun,&#x201d; published in Mexico with illustrator Margarita Sada. It is well known and widely praised for its artful, playful and powerful message of tolerance to children. 13 Colores de la Resistencia Hondure�a, or 13 Colors of the Honduran Resistance, has brought her renewed attention throughout Latin America since its publication two years ago in Costa Rica and Honduras.</p></p><h2>Bloodthirsty (A Buckhorn Western)</h2><p><b>JOHNSTONE COUNTRY.

A winner of the Commonwealth Writers Prize, he is the interim head of the Department of Public Information of the United Nations.The delightfully suspect and satirical tone of Tharoor's title informs and enlivens his monumental tale. In an opening disclaimer, the author cites the Mahabharata , an ancient Hindu epic, as the source of his inspiration. The story he retells, however, is also a thinly veiled account of the people and events that shaped India during the struggle for independence from British rule. Tharoor recasts these in a mythological, fictive realm, skillfully interweaving elements of traditional Eastern and Western literature. The epic, the sonnet, the novel and the folk tale all help to shape the narrative, just as history and myth, dream and reality intertwine in every chapter, calling into question the validity of categories. "One must be wary of history by anecdote," warns the narrator; one must be wary of "history" itself, suggests Tharoor. Despite his stereotypical treatment of British and Indian characters, he animates history with the imagination of an artist and the philosophy of a sage. Throughout, Tharoor appropriates titles, phrases and figures from the work of a pantheon of "first-world" writers, ranging from E. M. Forster and Rudyard Kipling to Ernest Hemingway and Arthur Koestler (and even including his contemporary Salman Rushdie)--a subtle but potent reversal of the traditional tide of cultural colonialism. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Present (Malory Novels (Paperback))</h2><p>As the entire Malory family gathers at Haverston to celebrate the season, a mysterious present arrives anonymously.

For starters it's a form of melodic, confessional, or EMOtional punk rock. But emo is more than a genre of music&#x2013;it's the defining counterculture movement of the '00s. EVERYBODY HURTS is a reference book for emo, tracing its angsty roots all the way from Shakespeare to Holden Caufield to today's most popular bands. </p><p> There's nothing new about that perfect chocolate and peanut butter combination&#x2013;&#x2013;teenagers and angst. What is new is that emo is the first cultural movement born on the internet. With the development of early social networking sites like Make Out Club (whose mission is to unite "like&#x2013;minded nerds, loners, indie rockers, record collectors, video gamers, hardcore kids, and artists through friendship, music, and sometimes even love") outcast teens had a place to find each other and share their pain, their opinions, and above all, their music&#x2013;which wasn't available for sale at the local record store.</p><p> Authors Leslie Simon and Trevor Kelley lead the reader through the world of emo including its ideology, music, and fashion, as well as its influences on film, television, and literature. With a healthy dose of snark and sarcasm, EVERYBODY HURTS uses diagrams, illustrations, timelines, and step&#x2013;by&#x2013;step instructions to help the reader successfully achieve the ultimate emo lifestyle. Or, alternately, teach him to spot an emo kid across the mall in order to mock him mercilessly.</p></p><p><p>Trevor Kelley is a leading contributor for <em>Alternative Press</em>. His work has also appeared in <em>Spin</em>, <em>NME</em>, and <em>Harp</em>. His favorite emo album of the past ten years is <em>Tell All Your Friends</em> by Taking Back Sunday. He lives in New York.</p><br><br><p>Leslie Simon is the author of <em>Wish You Were Here: An Essential Guide to Your Favorite Music Scenes</em> and co-author of <em>Everybody Hurts: An Essential Guide to Emo Culture</em>. Her work has appeared in Kerrang!, Alternative Press, metromix.com, and MTV.com.</p>For those who equate "emo" with lonely, malnourished rock bands, Alternative Press vets Simon and Kelley provide a vivisection of this deceptively large slice of the American pop culture pie: "it's a state of mind...a place for people who don't fit in-but who long to fit in with other people who don't fit in." With casual prose and unflagging energy, the authors look at a laundry list of emo affairs: fashion, internet, film, literature and music among them. Simon and Kelley know the territory inside and out, profiling ten emo types ("Trustafarian," "Christian," "Ex-Hardcore"), "emo ancestors" (including Emily Dickinson and Cameron Crowe), a detailed timeline and a comparative " 'Emo' vs. 'So Not Emo' " list-and that's just the first chapter. Unexpected resources and sarcastic swipes abound: record store recommendations segue into clever, cutting guidelines for naming your band. Readers will be reminded of Robert Lanham's The Hipster Handbook (right down to Rob Dobi's detailed, comic-realist illustrations), but like that title, Simon and Kelley's may not appeal to its subjects (emo fans read books primarily "to brag about them in social situations"). On the other hand, would-be scenesters will pick up plenty of tips-though there's a significant possibility that the info here will be dated in six months. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The brilliant criminologist returns with his partner and paramour Amelia Sachs, in a blistering bestseller that tests forensic detective work in a brave new world.<br><br>When Special Agent Kathryn Dance&#x2014;a brilliant interrogator and kinesics expert with the California Bureau of Investigation&#x2014;is sent to question the convicted killer Daniel &#x201c;Son of Manson&#x201d; Pell as a suspect in a newly unearthed crime, she feels both trepidation and electrifying intrigue. Pell is serving a life sentence for the brutal murders of the wealthy Croyton family in Carmel years earlier&#x2014;a crime mirroring those perpetrated by Charles Manson in the 1960s. But Pell and his cult members were sloppy: Not only were they apprehended, they even left behind a survivor&#x2014;the youngest of the Croyton daughters, who, because she was in bed hidden by her toys that terrible night, was dubbed the Sleeping Doll.<br> <br>But the girl never spoke about that night, nor did the crime's mastermind. Indeed, Pell has long been both reticent and unrepentant about the crime. And so with the murderer transported from the Capitola superprison to an interrogation room in the Monterey County Courthouse, Dance sees an opportunity to pry a confession from him for the recent murder&#x2014;and to learn more about the depraved mind of this career criminal who considers himself a master of control, a dark Svengali, forcing people to do what they otherwise would never conceive of doing. In an electrifying psychological jousting match, Dance calls up all her skills as an interrogator and kinesics&#x2014;body language&#x2014;expert to get to the truth behind Daniel Pell.<br> <br>But when Dance's plan goes terribly wrong and Pell escapes, leaving behind a trail of dead and injured, she finds herself in charge of her first-ever manhunt. But far from simply fleeing, Pell turns on his pursuers&#x2014;and other innocents&#x2014;for reasons Dance and her colleagues can't discern. As the idyllic Monterey Peninsula is paralyzed by the elusive killer, Dance turns to the past to find the truth about what Daniel Pell is really up to. She tracks down the now teenage Sleeping Doll to learn what really happened that night, and she arranges a reunion of three women who were in his cult at the time of the killings. The lies of the past and the evasions of the present boil up under the relentless probing of Kathryn Dance, but will the truth about Daniel Pell emerge in time to stop him from killing again?</p><p>Jeffery Deaver&nbsp;is the #1 international bestselling author of more than forty novels, three collections of short stories, and a nonfiction law book.

Subjects always did this, of course, though never with such astonishing eyes. Their color was a blue unlike sky or ocean or famous gems.</p><p>"Good morning," she said, sitting down across from him.</p><p>"And to you," replied Daniel Pell, the man who eight years ago had knifed to death four members of a family for reasons he'd never shared. His voice was soft.</p><p>A slight smile on his bearded face, the small, sinewy man sat back, relaxed. His head, covered with long, gray-black hair, was cocked to the side. While most jailhouse interrogations were accompanied by a jingling soundtrack of handcuff chains as subjects tried to prove their innocence with broad, predictable gestures, Daniel Pell sat perfectly still.</p><p>To Dance, a specialist in interrogation and kinesics -- body language -- Pell's demeanor and posture suggested caution, but also confidence and, curiously, amusement. He wore an orange jumpsuit, stenciled with "Capitola Correctional Facility" on the chest and "Inmate" unnecessarily decorating the back.</p><p>At the moment, though, Pell and Dance were not in Capitola but, rather, a secure interview room at the county courthouse in Salinas, forty miles away.</p><p>Pell continued his examination. First, he took in Dance's own eyes -- a green complementary to his blue and framed by square, black-rimmed glasses. He then regarded her French-braided, dark blond hair, the black jacket and beneath it the thick, unrevealing white blouse. He noted too the empty holster on her hip. He was meticulous and in no hurry. (Interviewers and interviewees share mutual curiosity. She told the students in her interrogation seminars, "They're studying you as hard as you're studying them -- usually even harder, since they have more to lose.")</p><p>Dance fished in her blue Coach purse for her ID card, not reacting as she saw a tiny toy bat, from last year's Halloween, that either twelve-year-old Wes, his younger sister, Maggie, or possibly both conspirators had slipped into the bag that morning as a practical joke. She thought: How's this for a contrasting life? An hour ago she was having breakfast with her children in the kitchen of their homey Victorian house in idyllic Pacific Grove, two exuberant dogs at their feet begging for bacon, and now here she sat, across a very different table from a convicted murderer.</p><p>She found the ID and displayed it. He stared for a long moment, easing forward. "Dance. Interesting name. Wonder where it comes from. And the California Bureau...what is that?"</p><p>"Bureau of Investigation. Like an FBI for the state. Now, Mr. Pell, you understand that this conversation is being recorded?"</p><p>He glanced at the mirror, behind which a video camera was humming away. "You folks think we really believe that's there so we can fix up our hair?"</p><p>Mirrors weren't placed in interrogation rooms to hide cameras and witnesses -- there are far better high-tech ways to do so -- but because people are less inclined to lie when they can see themselves.</p><p>Dance gave a faint smile. "And you understand that you can withdraw from this interview anytime you want and that you have a right to an attorney?"</p><p>"I know more criminal procedure than the entire graduating class of Hastings Law rolled up together. Which is a pretty funny image, when you think about it."</p><p>More articulate than Dance expected. More clever too.</p><p>The previous week, Daniel Raymond Pell, serving a life sentence for the 1999 murders of William Croyton, his wife and two of their children, had approached a fellow prisoner due to be released from Capitola and tried to bribe him to run an errand after he was free. Pell told him about some evidence he'd disposed of in a Salinas well years ago and explained that he was worried the items would implicate him in the unsolved murder of a wealthy farm owner. He'd read recently that Salinas was revamping its water system. This had jogged his memory and he'd grown concerned that the evidence would be discovered. He wanted the prisoner to find and dispose of it.</p><p>Pell picked the wrong man to enlist, though. The short-timer spilled to the warden, who called the Monterey County Sheriff's Office. Investigators wondered if Pell was talking about the unsolved murder of farm owner Robert Herron, beaten to death a decade ago. The murder weapon, probably a claw hammer, was never found. The Sheriff's Office sent a team to search all the wells in that part of town. Sure enough, they found a tattered T-shirt, a claw hammer and an empty wallet with the initials <i>R.H.</i> stamped on it. Two fingerprints on the hammer were Daniel Pell's.</p><p>The Monterey County prosecutor decided to present the case to the grand jury in Salinas, and asked CBI Agent Kathryn Dance to interview him, in hopes of a confession.</p><p>Dance now began the interrogation, asking, "How long did you live in the Monterey area?"</p><p>He seemed surprised that she didn't immediately begin to browbeat. "A few years."</p><p>"Where?"</p><p>"Seaside." A town of about thirty thousand, north of Monterey on Highway 1, populated mostly by young working families and retirees. "You got more for your hard-earned money there," he explained. "More than in your fancy Carmel." His eyes alighted on her face.</p><p>His grammar and syntax were good, she noted, ignoring his fishing expedition for information about her residence.</p><p>Dance continued to ask about his life in Seaside and in prison, observing him the whole while: how he behaved when she asked the questions and how he behaved when he answered. She wasn't doing this to get information -- she'd done her homework and knew the answers to everything she asked -- but was instead establishing his behavioral baseline.</p><p>In spotting lies, interrogators consider three factors: nonverbal behavior (body language, or kinesics), verbal quality (pitch of voice or pauses before answering) and verbal content (what the suspect says). The first two are far more reliable indications of deception, since it's much easier to control what we say than <i>how</i> we say it and our body's natural reaction when we do.</p><p>The baseline is a catalog of those behaviors exhibited when the subject is telling the truth. This is the standard the interrogator will compare later with the subject's behavior when he might have a reason to lie. Any differences between the two suggest deception.</p><p>Finally Dance had a good profile of the truthful Daniel Pell and moved to the crux of her mission in this modern, sterile courthouse on a foggy morning in June. "I'd like to ask you a few questions about Robert Herron."</p><p>Eyes sweeping her, now refining their examination: the abalone shell necklace, which her mother had made, at her throat. Then Dance's short, pink-polished nails. The gray pearl ring on the wedding-band finger got two glances.</p><p>"How did you meet Herron?"</p><p>"You're assuming I did. But, no, never met him in my life. I swear."</p><p>The last sentence was a deception flag, though his body language wasn't giving off signals that suggested he was lying.</p><p>"But you told the prisoner in Capitola that you wanted him to go to the well and find the hammer and wallet."</p><p>"No, that's what <i>he</i> told the warden." Pell offered another amused smile. "Why don't you talk to him about it? You've got sharp eyes, Officer Dance. I've seen them looking me over, deciding if I'm being straight with you. I'll bet you could tell in a flash that that boy was lying."</p><p>She gave no reaction, but reflected that it was very rare for a suspect to realize he was being analyzed kinesically.</p><p>"But then how did he know about the evidence in the well?"</p><p>"Oh, I've got that figured out. Somebody stole a hammer of mine, killed Herron with it and planted it to blame me. They wore gloves. Those rubber ones everybody wears on <i>CSI."</i></p><p>Still relaxed. The body language wasn't any different from his baseline. He was showing only emblems -- common gestures that tended to substitute for words, like shrugs and finger pointing. There were no adaptors, which signal tension, or affect displays -- signs that he was experiencing emotion.</p><p>"But if he wanted to do that," Dance pointed out, "wouldn't the killer just call the police <i>then</i> and tell them where the hammer was? Why wait more than ten years?"</p><p>"Being smart, I'd guess. Better to bide his time. Then spring the trap."</p><p>"But why would the real killer call the prisoner in Capitola? Why not just call the police directly?"</p><p>A hesitation. Then a laugh. His blue eyes shone with excitement, which seemed genuine. "Because <i>they're</i> involved too. The police. Sure...The cops realize the Herron case hasn't been solved and they want to blame somebody. Why not <i>me?</i> They've already got me in jail. I'll bet the cops planted the hammer themselves."</p><p>"Let's work with this a little. There're two different things you're saying. First, somebody stole your hammer <i>before</i> Herron was killed, murdered him with it and now, all this time later, dimes you out. But your second version is that the police got your hammer <i>after</i> Herron was killed by someone else altogether and planted it in the well to blame you. Those're contradictory. It's either one or the other. Which do you think?"</p><p>"Hm." Pell thought for a few seconds. "Okay, I'll go with number two. The police. It's a setup. I'm sure that's what happened."</p><p>She looked him in the eyes, green on blue. Nodding agreeably. </p><p>"Let's consider that. First, where would the police have gotten the hammer?"</p><p>He thought. "When they arrested me for that Carmel thing."</p><p>"The Croyton murders in ninety-nine?"</p><p>"Right. All the evidence they took from my house in Seaside."</p><p>Dance's brows furrowed. "I doubt that. Evidence is accounted for too closely. No, I'd go for a more credible scenario: that the hammer was stolen recently. Where else could somebody find a hammer of yours? Do you have any property in the state?"</p><p>"No."</p><p>"Any relatives or friends who could've had some tools of yours?"</p><p>"Not really."</p><p>Which wasn't an answer to a y...</p></p><h2>The Bernini Bust (Art History Mystery)</h2><p>British art historian Jonathan Argyll is in sunny Los Angeles conducting some profitable business with the Moresby Museum. Then the museum&#39;s owner is murdered and a Bernini bust disappears.

Educated at Wadham College, Oxford, he has worked as a journalist, an art historian, and a television consultant in England, France, Italy, and the United States. He is the author of seven highly praised detective novels, a book of art history, and countless articles on artistic, financial, and historical subjects, as well as the international bestseller <b>An Instance of the Fingerpost</b> He lives in Oxford, England.Jonathan Argyll, Pears's ( The Titian Committee ) endearingly incompetent British art historian and art dealer in Rome, falls into a large sale of a lesser Titian--with a hitch: he must take the oil painting to the private Moresby museum in L.A. without so much as a down payment. The museum lives up to its nouveau reputation, having a collection without focus, a curator with grandiose plans and some Moresby family members with personal agendas sniping at the budget. Jonathan and amiable but dodgy art dealer Hector di Souza are invited to a party to celebrate Moresby's commitment to the Big Museum, otherwise known as "the BM." As the acquisition of a lost Bernini bust of Pope Pius V is announced, di Souza is visibly distressed; moments later Moresby is dead and di Souza and the bust have disappeared. Jonathan calls his old love in Rome, Flavia de Stefano of the Italian National Art Theft Fund, to report on the smuggled and now missing bust and moments later just escapes being killed. Flavia, connecting the bust to an old war story involving some of the suspects, flies to L.A. and, joined by an Italian LAPD cop, tries to get Jonathan out of trouble, the killer in jail and the bust back to Roma. With sharply etched characters and art world lore, Pears's latest tale is a lark in grand British style. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Wise Children: A Novel (FSG Classics)</h2><p><p>In their heyday on the vaudeville stages of the early twentieth century, Dora Chance and her twin sister, Nora&#x2015;unacknowledged daughters of Sir Melchior Hazard, the greatest Shakespearean actor of his day&#x2015;were known as the Lucky Chances, with private lives as colorful and erratic as their careers.

One moment, you're in awe of the speed, skill and intensity that define the sport, shaking your head as a player makes an impossible play, or shatters a longstanding record, or sobs into his first Stanley Cup. The next, everyone's wearing earmuffs, Mr. Rogers has shown up, and guys in yellow raincoats are officiating playoff games while everyone tries to figure out where the league president went. That's just life in the NHL, a league that often can't seem to get out of its own way. No matter how long you've been a hockey fan, you know that sinking feeling that maybe, just maybe, some of the people in charge here don't actually know what they're doing. And at some point, you've probably wondered: Has it always been this way? <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The short answer is yes. As for the longer answer, well, that's this book.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this fun, irreverent and fact-filled history, Sean McIndoe relates the flip side to the National Hockey League's storied past. His obsessively detailed memory combines with his keen sense for the absurdities that make you shake your head at the league and yet fanatically love the game, allowing you to laugh even when your team is the butt of the joke (and as a life-long Leafs fan, McIndoe takes the brunt of some of his own best zingers). <i>The "Down Goes Brown" History of the NHL</i> is the weird and wonderful league's story told as only Sean McIndoe can.</p><p>SEAN McINDOE has appeared as a featured hockey columnist for sites including Sportsnet, VICE Sports, ESPN and <i>Grantland.</i> With his sense of humour, strong opinions and in-depth knowledge of the game's history, he has built one of the web's biggest hockey-writing readerships and produces new content throughout the season while making regular appearances on radio, television and podcasts. He maintains a large and loyal social media following, one that led <i>Sports Illustrated</i> to name him one of the 100 best Twitter follows in sports.&#x201c;In this fun, irreverent, and fact-filled history, McIndoe writes his obsessively detailed memories, combined with his keen sense for the head-shaking absurdities of the league. All this, while acknowledging the love for the game.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>The New Classical FM</b><br><br>&#x201c;McIndoe is definitely in his element writing <i>The Down Goes Brown History of the NHL</i>. . . .

Hilarious, insightful and the only hockey book I&#x2019;ve ever read that can balance a perceptive look at the history of fighting with how Harrison Ford indirectly saved the Colorado Avalanche. It&#x2019;s like having a guy at the pub giving you a master class in hockey history, except he&#x2019;s smarter and funnier than your drunk ass will ever be.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>Greg Wyshynski</b>, Senior NHL Writer, ESPN<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;On a sunny, summer afternoon from my cottage deck, I picked up Sean McIndoe&#x2019;s book and could not put it down until I was done reading it. <i>The Down Goes Brown History of the NHL</i> is a delightful read, of course humorous because it&#x2019;s McIndoe, but impressively informative in finding a way to cram 101 years of NHL hockey into 249 pages. The wonderfully written book is also a reminder that while the NHL is a business, it&#x2019;s also entertainment, and sometimes we need to stop taking ourselves so seriously.

It is not that I care two straws for His Royal Highness the Prince Regent&#x2019;s&nbsp;good opinion; indeed, I should regard the admiration of such a&nbsp;rou� as bordering upon insult; but there is an undeniable duty&nbsp;to answer a summons to Carlton House that demands the donning&nbsp;of one&#x2019;s best carriage gown, the coiffing of one&#x2019;s hair, and&nbsp;the hiring of a suitable chaise.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be thoroughly drenched, therefore, in the simple act of&nbsp;gaining that chaise, is a rebuke to misplaced vanity and expence.&nbsp;As I shivered on the threshold of the palace, my elegant boots<br> damp at the toes and my curls lank upon my brow, I could not&nbsp;bear to look at Manon hovering two steps behind me. My brother&#x2019;s&nbsp;French housekeeper had deplored this visit from the outset.&nbsp;She had no opinion of the Royal House, and appeared certain&nbsp;that all I should achieve by accepting the Prince&#x2019;s invitation&nbsp;was ravishment at his hands. She had insisted, therefore, upon<br> accompanying me&#x2014;my brother Henry being as yet too ill to&nbsp;leave his bed.<br> It was because of Henry&#x2014;who else but Henry?&#x2014;that I was&nbsp;known to Carlton House at all.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I arrived in London a month ago, expressly to negotiate the&nbsp;terms of publication of my latest novel, <i>Emma&#x2014;</i>an eventuality&nbsp;by no means assured<i>. </i>It has not been enough that my earlier&nbsp;works were generally admired, and briskly sold, nor that&nbsp;the third of these&#x2014;<i>Mansfield Park</i>&#x2014;has exhausted its first&nbsp;edition. My publisher, Mr. Thomas Egerton, refused a second&nbsp;edition of the latter, and spurned my fourth book entirely. I&nbsp;am inclined to attribute his disaffection to the dislike felt by&nbsp;some readers&#x2014;and perhaps Egerton himself&#x2014;for my saintly&nbsp;<i>Mansfield </i>heroine, Fanny Price. Where the arch and impertinent&nbsp;Lizzy Bennet found favour among the abandoned inhabitants of&nbsp;the Metropolis, Fanny was simply too <i>good </i>to be entertaining.&nbsp;Egerton must have feared that my spoilt and headstrong Emma&nbsp;should be similarly received; but in this he showed the limitations&nbsp;of a journeyman publisher. I suspect that Emma will prove the&nbsp;darling of the frivolous <i>ton</i>.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another lady might have read in Egerton&#x2019;s rebuff the instruction&nbsp;of Providence, and left off writing such dubious stuff as&nbsp;<i>novels</i>; my brother James, in his role as Divine Intermediary,&nbsp;counseled as much. He regards the indulgence of novel-reading&nbsp;as a dangerous diversion from Duty, particularly among women.&nbsp;To embrace the scandalous project of actually <i>writing </i>such&nbsp;books&#x2014;and profiting by them!&#x2014;is to tempt Satan. I would not&nbsp;have had James learn of Egerton&#x2019;s defection for the world, but&nbsp;my mother let slip some part of the intelligence, when relating&nbsp;the news of my journey to Hans Place.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My beloved Henry, far from scolding my arrogant proclivities,&nbsp;actually encourages them. In the face of Egerton&#x2019;s stupidity, he&nbsp;proposed that we approach none other than the illustrious Mr.<br> John Murray, of Albemarle Street, founder of the <i>Quarterly&nbsp;Review. </i>As Murray is well known to publish Lord Byron and&nbsp;Sir Walter Scott, the hubris of this notion was staggering. Only&nbsp;Henry could assume that a tale dismissed by an Egerton might&nbsp;be coveted by a Murray; our Henry has been tilting at windmills&nbsp;all his life. But in the event, his wager answered: Murray deigned<br> to glance at my <i>Emma</i>. It seems he was a little acquainted with&nbsp;Lizzy Bennet, and found her charming.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All matters of cost and gain being uncertain in these straitened&nbsp;months after Wellington&#x2019;s great victory, however, Murray proved&nbsp;cautious. He required a second opinion&#x2014;none other than that of&nbsp;the <i>Quarterly Review&#x2019;s </i>editor, Mr. William Gifford, who found&nbsp;&#x201c;nothing but good&#x201d; in my manuscript, and offered to edit it for&nbsp;publication. <i>Emma </i>having survived the scrutiny of so critical a&nbsp;reader, Murray offered me his price: �450 for the copyright.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For <i>Emma </i>alone, this should have proved acceptable. But&nbsp;being a rogue as well as a man of letters, Murray demanded the&nbsp;rights to <i>Mansfield Park </i>and <i>Sense and Sensibility </i>as well. Such<br> terms being likely to beggar me, I refused them. Miss Marianne&nbsp;Dashwood and Miss Mary Crawford cost me too much effort in&nbsp;their fashioning, to be cast upon the world for a pittance.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The delicate business was complicated by my brother&#x2019;s falling&nbsp;ill, of a trifling cold. He attempted to dictate from his bed&nbsp;an indignant letter to Mr. Murray, protesting the publisher&#x2019;s<br> terms, but was unequal to completing it. Henry&#x2019;s indisposition&nbsp;turned to something far more dangerous by the third week in&nbsp;October&#x2014;a low fever that worsened every hour. I had little time<br> or thought for business. Days passed with no improvement in&nbsp;my brother&#x2019;s condition. He was delirious and wandering, his&nbsp;pulse depressed.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The excellent Mr. Haden, our surgeon, bled Henry copiously,&nbsp;but urged me to inform my family of the gravity of his illness. I&nbsp;was so alarmed by Haden&#x2019;s sombre looks as to send Express to&nbsp;James at Steventon and Edward in Kent, that Henry&#x2019;s last hours&nbsp;might not go unwitnessed by those he loved. Indeed, so wrapped&nbsp;in misery was I, and so deprived of sleep, that I required the<br> presence of others to support me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James collected Cassandra on his way to London, which suggested&nbsp;he was not so entirely bereft of sense as I usually judge&nbsp;him. They were all three arrived in Hans Place by the twentyfourth&nbsp;of October, so that Manon and her mother had their&nbsp;hands full of Austens. Edward immediately urging the services&nbsp;of a more experienced man than Mr. Haden, Dr. Matthew<br> Baillie, the Court Physician, was summoned&#x2014;and so answered&nbsp;his patient&#x2019;s need, that by the thirtieth October, Henry was on&nbsp;the mend.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot describe the exquisite relief of being spared my&nbsp;particularly beloved brother. Suffice it to say that when the&nbsp;crisis was observed to have passed&#x2014;a little before dawn on<br> the twenty-ninth October&#x2014;that Cassandra and I, who had&nbsp;been sitting up together at the bedside, neither being willing to&nbsp;fail in the final moments of Henry&#x2019;s life, fell into each other&#x2019;s<br> arms and wept.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was some days before the patient could stand, or consume&nbsp;more than a little thick gruel. By the first week of November,&nbsp;however, Edward was gone back into Kent and James into&nbsp;Hampshire, taking my sister with him. I remained here in&nbsp;London to nurse Henry&#x2014;and see what could be done with my&nbsp;difficult <i>Emma.</i><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I wrote directly to John Murray and desired him to wait upon&nbsp;me in Hans Place. He was so good as to appear the following&nbsp;morning, and the briefest of conversations secured our mutual<br> satisfaction. I am to retain the copyright of <i>Emma, </i>publishing&nbsp;the work at my own expence; and Mr. Murray is to take ten&nbsp;percent of the profits, for his trouble in putting out the volumes.<br> As I followed a similar course with all my dearest children&nbsp;but <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>&#x2014;which copyright Egerton purchased&nbsp;outright for the sum of �110&#x2014;I am untroubled by fear of risk.<br> Murray has agreed to publish a second edition of <i>Mansfield Park,&nbsp;</i>on similar terms.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; James shall be appalled to learn that I have become a woman&nbsp;of Business, as well as Letters. My fallen nature is confirmed.<br><br>I had scarcely closed the door on one visitor, than another&nbsp;appeared in Hans Place&#x2014;entirely unknown to me, and unsettling&nbsp;in the extreme.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mr. James Stanier Clarke is a clergyman notable for his&nbsp;reliance upon Royal patronage. He is Historiographer to the&nbsp;King (tho&#x2019; what a madman may want with learning, is open to<br> question), a Canon of Windsor, and author of the yearly <i>Naval&nbsp;Chronicle, </i>which must endear him to everyone in the Austen&nbsp;family. He also wrote a fulsome biography of Admiral Lord&nbsp;Nelson, that praised all the hero&#x2019;s better qualities and ignored&nbsp;whatever was lamentable in his character&#x2014;an office Clarke&nbsp;undertook with the aid of the Duke of Clarence and the Prince&nbsp;Regent.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he sent in his card, I instructed Manon to convey&nbsp;Mr. Austen&#x2019;s compliments and the intelligence that he was&nbsp;as yet confined to his rooms. But Manon looked darkly and&nbsp;said that Mr. Clarke wished to interview <i>me</i>. I bade her show&nbsp;him up to the parlour, therefore, and prepared for a tedious&nbsp;quarter-hour.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Miss Austen!&#x201d; he cried, as tho&#x2019; we met again after many&nbsp;years parted. &#x201c;What pleasure is this, to trace in your gentle looks&nbsp;and modest attire the Genius that lends such animation to your<br> works&#x2014;and, I need not add, provides amusement to so many!&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bounded forward from the threshold, a round little man&nbsp;with fair hair and innocent blue eyes, very finely turned out in<br> a dark green coat. I stepped backwards, a trifle disconcerted,&nbsp;but managed a feeble curtsey. The fact of my authorship is but&nbsp;lately known, my first novel having been published as &#x201c;by a<br> Lady.&#x201d; Henry chose to explode my anonymity, entirely against&nbsp;instruction, and deposit the books at my feet for the World to&nbsp;criticise. I should have preferred to write in all the freedom of<br> obscurity, without the weight of either censure or praise.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Mr. Clarke,&#x201d; I acknowledged. &#x201c;I am grateful for your good&nbsp;opinion, sir. But I confess I cannot account for the honour of&nbsp;your presence in Hans Place. My brother is only lately delivered&nbsp;from his sickbed, and is quite unequal to the strain of visitors.&nbsp;How may I serve you?&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;By accepting my sincere congratulations on Mr. Henry&nbsp;Austen&#x2019;s deliverance, madam, and the good wishes of His Royal&nbsp;Highness the Prince Regent, who was informed of your brother&#x2019;s<br> illness in recent days&#x2014;and of your own angelic office, in nursing&nbsp;him back to health&#x2014;by our esteemed mutual acquaintance, Dr.&nbsp;Matthew Baillie.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Court Physician. He had impressed me as a quiet and&nbsp;efficient fellow, spare of figure and ugly of countenance, with a&nbsp;monkey&#x2019;s shrewd eyes. Why should he canvass the difficulties of<br> a common banker and his sister around the card tables at Carlton&nbsp;House? Henry&#x2019;s pockets had been thoroughly emptied by the&nbsp;Regent&#x2019;s circle in the past&#x2014;he was forever lending money on<br> generous terms to friends of Eliza&#x2019;s, and my late sister had been&nbsp;acquainted with far too many of the Great; but&#x2014;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The Regent, I may say, was instantly electrified to learn of&nbsp;<i>Miss Jane Austen&#x2019;s </i>residence in the Metropolis,&#x201d; Clarke persisted,&nbsp;bowing low, &#x201c;and despatched me to your door with all possible&nbsp;haste.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I groped behind me for a chair.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That the presence in London of a woman unremarkable for&nbsp;birth, beauty, blowsy corpulence, or loose morals should be&nbsp;immediately electrifying to the Prince Regent!&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You must know,&#x201d; Clarke added, &#x201c;that His Royal Highness&nbsp;keeps a complete set of your works, handsomely bound, in each&nbsp;of his residences. The young Princess Charlotte has also found&nbsp;them vastly entertaining.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Pray sit down, sir,&#x201d; I said faintly.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The cherub beamed, and did so.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I am instructed to convey all that is proper of His Royal&nbsp;Highness&#x2019;s esteem and commendation, Miss Austen, and to&nbsp;offer the considerable resources and ample solitude of the<br> Library at Carlton House, for your use and pleasure, should&nbsp;you require it, during your stay in London. I may add that His&nbsp;Royal Highness has further instructed Dr. Baillie to call here<br> in Hans Place each day and carry a report of your brother&#x2019;s&nbsp;progress to Carlton House&#x2014;the Regent being most anxious&nbsp;for Mr. Austen&#x2019;s return to robust health.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am afraid I openly frowned at the little man, so incomprehensible&nbsp;did this speech seem. Had Henry been in his usual high&nbsp;spirits and stout form, I should have suspected him of hiring the<br> fellow to trick me.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;The Library at Carlton House? The Regent intends for me&nbsp;to <i>write </i>there?&#x201d;<br> &#x201c;Not if you should dislike it,&#x201d; Mr. Clarke said hurriedly.&nbsp;&#x201c;But I cannot conceive why you should. It is in every way an&nbsp;admirable chamber, lined with a varied and thorough selection&nbsp;of works on every subject; handsomely appointed, the lighting&nbsp;good, the warmth without question (His Royal Highness is&nbsp;highly particular about the heating of his rooms)&#x2014;and as&nbsp;nobody at Carlton House is excessively devoted to literature,&nbsp;generally empty.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This last, I could well believe; and as the final note rang true,&nbsp;I must credit the whole.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You are very good, sir,&#x201d; I said, rising with an air that must&nbsp;be read as dismissal&#x2014;&#x201c;and the Regent&#x2019;s generosity is nothing&nbsp;short of remarkable. Please say everything proper to His Royal<br> Highness, of my gratitude for his notice and his esteem. It must&nbsp;be impossible for me to accept his kind invitation, however. The&nbsp;demands of my brother&#x2019;s precarious health make any interests of&nbsp;my own immaterial at present.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The expression of dismay on poor Mr. Clarke&#x2019;s face was so&nbsp;sudden and ill-disguised that I very nearly disgraced myself with&nbsp;laughter. His disappointment was vast, and his discomfiture<br> palpable. He stood to his full height of five feet and turned agitatedly&nbsp;before the hearth, his hands clasped upon his stomach. It&nbsp;was evident I had committed some solecism, and by my refusal&nbsp;presented Mr. Clarke with a problem.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;My <i>dear </i>Miss Austen,&#x201d; he managed at length, &#x201c;be assured I&nbsp;have every sympathy with the family difficulties you entertain. I&nbsp;am sensible of the burdens that rest so heavily upon the shoulders&nbsp;of a writer, too, being not unacquainted with the demands of&nbsp;that celestial endeavour myself. &#x2014;You <i>are </i>in the midst of some&nbsp;noble creation of the pen, I assume?

The Liturgical Press began in the 1930s to publish books and other materials related to Benedictine monastic life and spirituality. Leonard Doyle&#39;s translation of St. Benedict&#39;s Rule for Monasteries appeared in 1948 and has remained in print ever since. Generations of monastics, oblates and others whose lives are influenced by monastic spirituality, have encountered the Rule by means of Doyle&#39;s work, which remains by far the most widely known and used English version of the Rule. The traditional dates for the thrice-yearly reading of the Rule are included in this edition. Simple, clear text and beautiful cover art enhance the value of this edition. The elegance of the page, as crafted by the master eye of renowned liturgical artist and designer Frank Kacmarcik, Obl.S.B., makes it a treasure to read and study as Benedict intended. With ribbon marker.&#34;The simple elegance of the layout and typography designed by Frank Kacmarcik, Obl.S.B., the creamy feel of the paper, and the compelling presentation of the book in a rich blue binding with ribbon marker makes this both a treasure and a bargain. The quality of design invites the reader into the wonder of the text itself, and Doyle&#39;s clean, memorable rendering of the original Latin speaks nobly from the page. . . . This handsome new edition . . . is both age-old and ever new, the perfect gift for admirers of monasticism or of fine books?and a fine treat for yourself.&#34; The Abbey BannerLeonard J. Doyle (1914-1970) was a gifted translator of German, French, Latin, and Italian works for The Liturgical Press, in addition to operating his own publishing company, Doyle and Finegan. His translations include such titles as<i>&nbsp;</i><i>Parish Holy Week Missal</i>&nbsp;(1956),&nbsp;<i>The Simplification of the Rubrics&nbsp;</i>(1955),&nbsp;<i>Commentary for Benedictine Oblates&nbsp;</i>(1950),&nbsp;<i>Benedictinism Through Changing Centuries</i>&nbsp;(1958),&nbsp;A <i>History of Benedictine Nuns</i>&nbsp;(1958), among others. After Vatican II he worked on the official liturgical books published by The Liturgical Press, including the Lectionary, the Sacramentary, and the Breviary. His translation from Latin of&nbsp;<i>St. Benedict's Rule for Monasteries,</i>which was published in 1948, is still sold by The Liturgical Press.</p><h2>Revolutionary Brotherhood: Freemasonry and the Transformation of the American Social Order, 1730-1840 (Published by the Omohundro Institute of Early ... and the University of North Carolina Press)</h2><p>In the first comprehensive history of the fraternity known to outsiders primarily for its secrecy and rituals, Steven Bullock traces Freemasonry through its first century in America. He follows the order from its origins in Britain and its introduction into North America in the 1730s to its near-destruction by a massive anti-Masonic movement almost a century later and its subsequent reconfiguration into the brotherhood we know today. With a membership that included Benjamin Franklin, George Washington, Paul Revere, and Andrew Jackson, Freemasonry is fascinating in its own right, but Bullock also places the movement at the center of the transformation of American society and culture from the colonial era to the rise of Jacksonian democracy. Using lodge records, members' reminiscences and correspondence, and local and Masonic histories, Bullock links Freemasonry with the changing ideals of early American society. Although the fraternity began among colonial elites, its spread during the Revolution and afterward allowed it to play an important role in shaping the new nation's ideas of liberty and equality. Ironically, however, the more inclusive and universalist Masonic ideas became, the more threatening its members' economic and emotional bonds seemed to outsiders, sparking an explosive attack on the fraternity after 1826.

With elegance and clarity he demonstrates that major tenets promulgated in the name of Science are not in fact scientific truths but rather scientistic speculations - for which there is no evidence at all. Step by step the reader is led to the astonishing realization that the specifically &#39;modern&#39; world is based intellectually upon nothing more substantial than a syndrome of Promethean myths. But this is only half of what the book accomplishes. Its primary contribution is to recover and reaffirm the deep metaphysical and religious insights that have come down to us through the teachings of Christianity. And herein lies the true worth of this remarkable treatise: having broken the grip of scientistic presuppositions, the author succeeds admirably in bringing to view great truths that had long been obscured.</p><p>Wolfgang Smith graduated from Cornell University at age eighteen with majors in physics, philosophy, and mathematics. After taking an M.S. in physics at Purdue, he pursued research in aerodynamics, where his papers on diffusion fields provided the theoretical key to the solution of the re-entry problem for space flight. After receiving a Ph.D. in mathematics from Columbia University, Dr. Smith held faculty positions at M.I.T., U.C.L.A., and Oregon State University, where he served as Professor of Mathematics until his retirement in 1992. In addition to numerous technical publications (relating to differential topology), Dr. Smith has published three previous books and many articles dealing with foundational and interdisciplinary problems. He has been especially concerned to unmask conceptions of a scientistic kind widely accepted today as scientific truths."<i>Cosmos and Transcendence</i> is an excellent book, and would be an asset in any course dealing with science and philosophy, or the history of science. It is also most fascinating reading, and would be a welcome addition to any library." -- Harold Hughesdon, The Wanderer<br><br>"Wolfgang Smith is as important a thinker as our times boast." -- Huston Smith, author of <i>The World's Religions</i><br><br>"Having traced the degeneration of the mechanistic outlook into subjectivism and pseudoscience, Dr. Smith concludes his book with a profound reflection on the fall of man and its implications for the pursuit of knowledge. . . . This is a serious work which will repay close attention." -- Robert P. Rooney, Homiletic &amp; Pastoral Review<br><br>"We are astounded to see the revival of philosophical doctrines long thought dead in a scientific context. . . . This book will repay study, especially its brilliant third chapter, 'Lost Horizons'." -- John C. Caiazza, Modern Age<br><br>"This is a very interesting book for the general reader as for the scientist." -- Fellowship of Catholic Scholars Newsletter</p><h2>Understanding Folk Religion: A Christian Response to Popular Beliefs and Practices</h2><p>Provides a model for examining the beliefs folk religions around the world and suggests biblical principles missionaries can use to deal with them.</p><p>The late<b> Paul G. Hiebert </b>(1932-2007) was distinguished professor of mission and anthropology at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School and previously taught at Fuller Theological Seminary. <b>R. Daniel Shaw</b> is professor of anthropology and translation at Fuller Theological Seminary. <b>Tite Ti�nou</b> is professor of theology of mission at Trinity Evangelical Divinity School.A book for all Christians to read who are serious about deep-level spiritual transformation. Our cultural upbringing often hides from our awareness areas of life that need to be confronted by the gospel. Reading this book will help uncover aspects of our own worldview and practice that are more informed by North American culture than by the kingdom values of the Lord Jesus Christ. There are few resources available, apart from living in a cross-cultural context, that can do what this book can accomplish. Can a person worship Christ on Sunday and visit a witch doctor on Monday morning for a healing remedy? This is the question Hiebert and his colleagues deal with in an effort to uncover what people really believe in a variety of cultures. They demonstrate how Christian missionaries have often forced folk beliefs underground when they actually thought they had rooted them out. They do a masterful job of providing the framework of a biblical response to a number of issues. -- <i>Clinton Arnold</i><br><br>An excellent resource book to serve as a text in missiology classes addressing folk religions and critical contextualization. The book provides a substantive overview of the characteristics of folk religions and excellent guidelines for a thoroughly biblical response to these religions in Christian mission. A significant strength of the volume are the chapters which focus on the central questions of life addressed in folk religions, and the biblical principles essential for a Christian response. The exceptional chapter on sacred myths shows how Indo-European myths have influenced missionary bias and popular theologies of spiritual warfare. The book concludes by identifying the key theological issues of relevance for new and maturing churches in folk communities. For missionaries and Christian workers in folk societies around the world, this book provides sound theoretical understanding, comprehensive elucidation of the characteristics of folk religions, and fundamental biblical and theological principles for practical application in ministry.<p> -- <i>Sherwood Lingenfelter, dean, School of World Missions, Fuller Theological Seminary</i><br><br>As a missionary in Central America, I saw professing Christians sacrifice chickens on their way to church. As a missions professor in North America, I see professing Christians consult horoscopes for daily guidance. This much needed and long overdue volume provides the perspective needed to understand the what and why of the everyday religious beliefs and practicesboth old and newthat actually shape the lives of their adherents. Contains culturally sensitive, theologically sound, and missiologically astute guidelines for communicating biblical truth in a transforming way. -- <i>Kenneth B. Mulholland, dean, Columbia Bible Institute &amp; Graduate School of Missions</i><br><br>Here is a book that really does what the title suggests: It effectively helps Christians understand and respond to the beliefs and practices of folk religion, at home and abroad. -- <i>Gerald H.

Why can't Detroit make a car that's 100 percent efficient? Why can't some genius make a perpetual motion machine? The answers lie in the field of thermodynamics, the study of heat, which turns out to be the key to an astonishing number of scientific puzzles, including why time inexorably runs in only one direction.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>In <b>Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat</b>, physics professor Hans Christian von Baeyer tells the story of heat through the lives of the scientists who discovered it. With his trademark elegant prose, eye for lively detail, and gift for lucid explanation, Professor von Baeyer turns the contemplation of a cooling coffee cup into a beguiling portrait of the birth of a science with relevance to almost every aspect of our lives.</p><p><i>Warmth Disperses and Time Passes</i> deals with, among other things, "Maxwell's Demon," a metaphorical device invented by James Clerk Maxwell a century and a half ago in an attempt to expose flaws in the second law of thermodynamics. This imaginary demon would sit between two flasks of air and allow only warm air molecules to enter the warmer flask. This would cause heat to flow uphill--a death knell for the second law if it were possible. Only it wasn't; it was the death knell for the demon instead. Successive "improved" demons were invented by later physicists, but all have subsequently been killed. The realization that a live demon is impossible has served to further strengthen the second law. <p> Hans von Baeyer is almost as much historian as scientist. As he walks us through the evolution of scientific understanding of thermodynamics, he stops to dwell on the intellectual and societal framework that allowed the physicists of the time to make their respective scientific leaps. This blend of science and history, combined with von Baeyer's journalistic approach, creates a book that is both exceedingly accessible and surprisingly illuminating. <i>--Eric Warner</i></p>"Hans von Baeyer's writing style is so compelling that it would induce even the most scientifically na�ve reader to care about the laws of thermodynamics."--Publishers Weekly, starred review<p>"Professor von Baeyer is a prime candidate for best wordsmith among popularizers of physics, composing prose that is elegant, economical and, above all, civilized."--Physics Today</p><p>"Hans von Baeyer uses common sense and familiar observations as a tool for exploring deep scientific principles."--Library Journal, Best Sci-Tech Books of 1998</p><p>"Hans Christian von Baeyer has published a highly readable, highly humanized account of the second law of thermodynamics. He gives what could be an abstract and difficult discussion a profoundly human tone."--The Boston Globe</p></p><h2>Marilyn Monroe Paper Dolls (Dover Celebrity Paper Dolls)</h2><p>This incredibly lifelike Marilyn Monroe paper doll comes with 31 accurate costumes from 24 films.

Rumor ran rampant: A wild-eyed foreign anarchist with an unpronounceable name had killed the commander-in-chief. Eric Rauchway's brilliant <i>Murdering McKinley</i> restages Leon Czolgosz's hastily conducted trial and then traverses America with Dr. Vernon Briggs, a Boston alienist who sets out to discover why Czolgosz rose up to kill his president.</p></p><p><p><b>Eric Rauchway</b> has written about history for <i>The Financial Times</i> and <i>The Los Angeles Times</i>. He teaches at the University of California, Davis and is the author of <i>The Refuge of Affections</i>. He lives in Northern California.</p>This ambitious book paints a fresh picture of American culture a century ago and finds there the confused stirrings of our own age. Rauchway's lens opens on the 1901 assassination of President William McKinley by Leon Czolgosz and keeps that event in focus throughout. The author's aim is to get us to understand in new ways the dawning 20th century, when so many of our present political and social struggles took form and solutions were proposed. For instance, the involvement in Czolgosz's case of "alienists" and criminologists provides Rauchway (The Refuge of Affections) with openings into such varied issues as nativism, racism, industrial conditions and social work. As for politics, he deals skillfully with now mostly forgotten issues-such as tariffs and currency policy-that rarely appeal to readers, but which here gain clarity through Rauchway's deft brevity. Most important, he shows how the nation's culture, and Theodore Roosevelt, who gained the presidency on McKinley's death, got caught up in a debate about the reasons for the murder. Was Czolgosz spurred by his psychological state or by anarchist ideology? Did the murder's origins lie within the assassin or in the social conditions that produce desperate people? These are issues that continue to divide Americans. And the book shines in dealing with them, making an important contribution to historical understanding. Rauchway's explanation for Roosevelt's 1912 loss as "Bull Moose" candidate of the Progressive Party-that he was caught between opposing interpretations of the roots of the nation's ills-is especially provocative. That alone should make the book controversial. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Kiss of Snow (Psy-Changeling Novel, A)</h2><p><b>A Psy/Changeling novel from the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Shards of Hope</i>,&nbsp;<i>Shield of Winter</i>, and <i>Heart of Obsidian</i></b>.<br><br>Since her defection from the PsyNet and into the SnowDancer wolf pack, Sienna Lauren has had one weakness: <i>Hawke</i>. <br><br>Alpha and dangerous, he lost the woman who would've been his mate long ago.

Sienna Lauren is a rare Psy X who can wreak devastation with cold fire. Sienna has fought hard to control her abilities, knowing she'll most likely burn out and die by age 25, but she can't control her longing for alpha wolf Hawke. Hawke is drawn to her too, but there are barriers between them: age, station, and the death of his destined mate. Hawke and Sienna's fight against their fierce attraction parallels the beginnings of real war against antichangeling Psy factions&#x2014;a war in which Sienna may have to use the powers that could destroy her. Singh deftly eliminates Sienna's potential love interest and adds a sweet secondary romance that contrasts with the violent intensity of Sienna and Hawke's relationship. First-time readers may be a little overwhelmed, but fans who have been longing for this story will not be disappointed.

This democratic understanding of the worth and standing of the individual lies at the core of what the West calls enlightenment. The Western idea of enlightenment, rooted in the great vision of the Biblical prophets, is generally understood to have entered mainstream consciousness through the political democratic movements of the mid 18th century. Western enlightenment is primarily concerned with the democratization of political power. Classical enlightenment, sometimes called Eastern enlightenment because it was greatly emphasized in the East, is about the individual merging into the greater one. The appearance of separate self is an illusion, which must be overcome as the individual realizes that one is really not separate at all but part of the one. The goal of Eastern enlightenment is moving beyond the grasping ego and desperately seeking separate self by attaining a state of consciousness in which the illusion of separateness was dissolved in the greater one. This path of classical enlightenment is seen as the path beyond suffering. Unique Self enlightenment brings the Eastern and Western understandings about enlightenment together, into a higher Integral World Spirituality embrace. Unique Self enlightenment is based on your commitment to transcend separate self into the one, even as you realize that that essence sees through your unique perspective. Unique Self opens the door to the potential democratization of enlightenment. To awaken to your Unique Self is to be lived as God, which, in truth, means to be lived as love.</p><p>We once believed that to be enlightened was a process of evolving beyond your experience of being a skin encapsulated ego, your separate self, in order to realize your essence as indivisible from the seamless coat of the universe. This is actually the first stage of a much greater journey. What unfolds next is the realization of your true uniqueness as the highest expression of enlightenment. <i>Your Unique Self</i> offers a paradigm-shifting investigation into the nature of spiritual awakening and the underlying purpose of human existence. This book speaks dangerous words -- dangerous to your sense that you are small -- to your feeling that you are invisible or alone. <i>Your Unique Self</i> dares you to listen dangerously -- to embrace your greatness and open to the infinite love intelligence that yearns to enter the world as you."<i>Your Unique Self</i> is one of the most brilliant, provocative, and original books of the new century. Dr. Marc Gafni has fused together the deepest insights of the Eastern and Western mystery traditions to provide an evolutionary road map for the great birth that is arising in and through our contemporary world crisis. This is indispensible reading for all lovers of Integral Spirituality and universal mysticism. The vision of the Unique Self is absolutely essential for the next step of evolution, and I cannot recommend it highly enough."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Andrew Harvey, author of <i>The Hope: A Guide to Sacred Activism</i><br><br>"With exceptional brilliance and an awakened heart, Dr. Marc Gafni speaks to all of us who are interested in the evolution of consciousness. His teachings on the Unique Self enlightenment are essential for the next stage in our evolution. They have emerged from his direct experience, and I highly recommend them."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Michael Bernard Beckwith, author of&nbsp;<i>Spiritual Liberation: Fulfilling Your Soul's Potential</i><br><br>"Marc, a fellow drinker at the holy taverns has written a fine, fine book. Kabbalists say a Day of Tikkun (evolution, soul-repair) is coming. There are great stories here from the Hasidic masters and from Marc's own life, honoring the unique soulmaking that has brought you to this moment. This book will deepen that astonishing mystery and awaken you to the individual beauty of your path."<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Coleman Barks, author of&nbsp;<i>Rumi: The Big Red Book</i><br><br>"Dr. Marc Gafni has written an brilliant book, Your Unique Self, which I believe is essential reading. "Your Unique Self" articulates a bold evolutionary, spiritual, philosophy that calls every individual to realize their Unique Self and give their Unique Gifts in an evolutionary context. Gafni, together with his colleague Ken Wilber, is a bold visionary and a catalytic voice for the newly emergent World Spirituality movement, which combines the best of pre-modern, modern, and post-modern insight.

Lighthearted and sparkling with witty banter, <i>Highland Fling</i> was Mitford&#x2019;s first foray into the delightful fictional world for which the author of <i>The Pursuit of Love </i>and <i>Love in a Cold Climate </i>later became so celebrated.<br><br>With an Introduction by Julian Fellowes, creator of <i>Downton Abbey.</i></p><p><b>Nancy Mitford</b>, daughter of Lord and Lady Redesdale and the eldest of the six legendary Mitford sisters, was born in 1904 and educated at home on the family estate in Oxfordshire. She made her debut in London and soon became one of the bright young things of the 1920s, a close friend of Henry Green, Evelyn Waugh, John Betjeman, and their circle. A beauty and a wit, she began writing for magazines and writing novels while she was still in her twenties. In all, she wrote eight novels as well as biographies of Madame de Pompadour, Voltaire, Louis XIV, and Frederick the Great. She died in 1973. More information can be found at www.nancymitford.com.<i>Excerpted from the Introduction</i><br><br>In a sense,<i> Highland Fling </i>is a taster of coming delights. It was Nancy Mitford&#x2019;s first novel, published in 1931 when she was still in her twenties, and among its pages the reader may find seeds of the characters that would so memorably people her later books, <i>The Pursuit of Love and Love in a Cold Climate</i>, for both of which she is justly celebrated. General Murgatroyd is certainly the ancestor of Uncle Matthew, both descending, as they do, from Mitford&#x2019;s own father, Lord Redesdale, who must surely rank as her principal source material throughout her career. I always enjoy his response when he was accused of discrimination. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t discriminate,&#x2019; he spluttered indignantly. &#x2018;I hate everybody.&#x2019; But alongside the splenetic General, there are clear traces of Linda Radlett in Jane Dacre, Lady Prague lays the groundwork for Lady Montdore, Albert Memorial Gates is a precursor of Cedric Hampton, and so on. But if it is fun to find the clues of what would come after, the book has its own merit in that this is the first time Mitford attempted to quantify and codify and explain the world of her beginnings, always seen with her wonderful, comic vision.<br><br>Admittedly, this world was not a hard place. Young couples live on nothing at all, highland castles are lent and borrowed, no one seems to have much in mind beyond some decent shooting and dinner at the club. Only Albert is engaged in anything remotely resembling a profession and that as a surrealist painter. Mitford&#x2019;s men did not push pens or languish behind desks; her women spent their time gossiping and changing their clothes. Nor did they question the rules of a society that allowed them to idle away their days, or ask why they should be waited on hand and foot even when they hadn&#x2019;t a penny to their name. But that is what makes this account of them a restful and hilarious read. It was a thoughtless age, perhaps, and even a selfish one, but without our moral smuggery which prompts every soap opera celebrity to veil their own self-obsession with much vaunted, anguished care for the environment or the survival of the whale. There is an honesty in that.<br><br>As a young woman, Nancy Mitford was madly, if quite unsuccessfully, in love with a Scottish aristocrat, Hamish St Clair-Erskine, and it is hard not to feel that Highland Fling may, in some ways, be a form of revenge after those wasted, tearful years in fruitless pursuit. How much time must she have spent in just such houses as Dalloch Castle, waiting for Hamish to love her, and how frustrating it must have been. Lord Craigdalloch himself, to say nothing of horsy Lady Brenda Chadlington or the intolerably dull Admiral Wenceslaus, all have the quality of being drawn from life, while the snobbish and philistine Lady Prague comes in for particularly savage treatment. &#x2018;Why let her learn oils?&#x2019; said Lady Prague. &#x2018;There are too many oil paintings in the world already. Let her do water colours. They take up much less room.&#x2019; Guided by Mitford&#x2019;s sly description, we grasp at once why Lady Prague would be quite unable to resist Mrs Fairfax, an amoral bolter of the first order, because, during her many marriages, Mrs Fairfax has given birth to an English marquess and an Italian duke. &#x2018;Dear Louisa,&#x2019; explains Lady Prague, &#x2018;was always such a high-spirited girl, she can scarcely be blamed for her actions.&#x2019; But when others without so many connections in the ranks of the Peerage break her ladyship&#x2019;s rules, there can be no mercy for them. The point is that Mitford knows these men and women. She knows how they work. She grasps their self-interest and their hypocrisy and their double standards. I would not say she never loves them, or some of them, but she knows them for what they are.<br><br>In Highland Fling, as always with this author, there is the vividness of personal experience in her work and this pre-war group do seem to embody exactly what a clever, quick-witted woman must have found so hard to endure about that oh-sopredictable life on the hill. It is a culture of watching others kill all day, getting ever more cold and wet before returning to freezing baths and bad dinners with boring people. Indeed, she writes with such relish that I am convinced the fate she metes out to the scene of their pleasures is one she wished on too many of such house parties in this unsatisfactory period of her own past. Because, for me, that is the key to Mitford&#x2019;s genius: her intimate knowledge of this world and these people. Indeed, no one knew it&#x2014;or certainly could articulate it&#x2014;better. But, in her own way, even by this stage of her life, she had grown out of its limited values and, free as she was, she could afford to turn the torch of her own acerbic wit on a tribe who thought themselves the very acme of high life and high principle but were instead living in a foolish and largely pointless bubble, a bubble, what is more, that was soon to burst.<br><br>Of course there is cruelty here beneath the comedy, a kind of sharpness that bears testimony to the force of her judgement even where it is wrapped in the cotton wool of humour. But most of all, there is truth. And truth, as all the world knows, is the basis of great comedy.</p><h2>Retrotopia</h2><p>FORWARD TO THE PAST The year is 2065. Decades ago, the United States of America fell apart after four brutal years of civil war, and the fragments coalesced into new nations divided by economic and political rivalries. Most of the post-US America is wracked by poverty and civil strife, with high-tech skyscrapers rising above crowded, starving slums&#x2014;but one of the new nations, the Lakeland Republic of the upper Midwest, has gone its own way, isolated from the rest by closed frontiers and trade embargoes. Now Peter Carr, an emissary from the newly elected administration in the Atlantic Republic, boards a train to cross the recently reopened border into Lakeland territory on a mission that could decide the fate of his nation. Ahead of him lies a cascade of experiences that will challenge his most basic assumptions about economics, politics, and the direction history is moving. Alone among the post-USA republics of North America, the Lakeland Republic has achieved prosperity and internal peace, and it&#x2019;s done so by modeling its future... ...on the past.</p><p></p><h2>Together: The Rituals, Pleasures and Politics of Cooperation</h2><p><p><b>In this sequel to his influential work <i>The Craftsman</i>, Richard Sennett explores how we can learn to cooperate in the intensely tribal, competitive, and self-interested cultures we inhabit</b><br><br> Living with people who differ&#x2014;racially, ethnically, religiously, or economically&#x2014;is the most urgent challenge facing civil society today. We tend socially to avoid engaging with people unlike ourselves, and modern politics encourages the politics of the tribe rather than of the city. In this thought-provoking book, Richard Sennett discusses why this has happened and what might be done about it.</p><p>Sennett contends that cooperation is a craft, and the foundations for skillful cooperation lie in learning to listen well and discuss rather than debate. In <i>Together</i> he explores how people can cooperate online, on street corners, in schools, at work, and in local politics. He traces the evolution of cooperative rituals from medieval times to today, and in situations as diverse as slave communities, socialist groups in Paris, and workers on Wall Street. Divided into three parts, the book addresses the nature of cooperation, why it has become weak, and how it could be strengthened. The author warns that we must learn the craft of cooperation if we are to make our complex society prosper, yet he reassures us&nbsp;that we can do this, for the capacity for cooperation is embedded in human nature.</p></p><p>The highly respected author of <i>The Craftsman</i> now explores how we can create a better society by learning to truly listen and cooperate with others, even when our interests are conflicting.<p>Praise for Richard Sennett&#x2019;s <i>The Craftsman</i></p> <p>"In <i>The Craftsman</i>&nbsp;[Sennett] compellingly explores the universe of skilled work, where 'the desire to do a job well done for its own sake' still flourishes."&#x2014;Brian C.

Drawing the patterns is not just a question of mechanically copying the work of someone else square by square, but of understanding the underlying structure. The patterns are built up from simple elements which seem to &#x2018;grow&#x2019; and develop in an almost organic or living way. This book is arranged as a series of drawing exercises. There is no better way of appreciating the skill and imagination of those artists than by drawing their designs yourself. To &#x2018;feel&#x2019; how a cross &#x2018;grows&#x2019; into a swastika pattern which then &#x2018;grows&#x2019; into a complex interlocking design is something which can only be experienced at first hand. This second edition incorporates the same &#x201c;drawing led&#x201d; approach to learning about the subject and as such is invaluable in using the designs for contemporary mosaic, or pattern, design. New photographs and updated text strengthen this approach further. Ideal for schools, shops in or near Roman remains, and historical and art/design sections of shops.</p><p>Mosaic as a medium for artistic expression has been to the forefront of Robert Field&#39;s creative life for more than a decade. Before taking early retirement from teaching, during which time he had held various Art and Craft posts, he started travelling widely in the Roman world studying and photographing mosaics. This took him to Italy, North Africa and the Near East, Cyprus and Spain and later in search of Norman mosaics in Sicily and to Greece and Turkey to see Byzantine examples. Following this he began to study Victorian and modern mosaics which he has examined and photographed extensively in Britain as well as in Europe and America. In addition to being a founder member of the British Association for Modern Mosaic (BAMM) he also served for a number of years on the committee of the Association for the Study and Preservation of Roman Mosaics (ASPROM) and is a member of L&#39;Association Internationale pour l&#39;etude de la Mosaique Antique (AIEMA) whose conferences he has attended at a variety of venues around the world.A successful author, Robert Field has written six books on geometric patterns which have sold many thousands copies world-wide. These are used by many people as a source of creative design in subjects as diverse as embroidery, patio paving, knitwear and quilt making.&#34;An A5 sized booklet that is full of great ideas and illustrations for you to draw your own mosaics. Teachers, mathematicians, set makers and Quilters would all find this timeless book useful. It clearly teaches the reader how to make Roman Mosaic patterns and can be adapted at will. For the lay reader who has an interest it is a wonderful source book. For a mathematician interested in tessellation it is likewise. It would make a good addition to any Mathematician&#39;s library.&#34; Glenn Cook</p><h2>Atlas of the Human Body</h2><p><p><em>The Atlas of the Human Body</em> gives clear and thorough explanations of each of the major organs and systems of the human body.

Named after the surly general and chief architect of the state, the airport is a testament to Israel&#x2019;s self-ascribed position as a bastion of social and technological advancement amid a sea of inchoate enemies. In fact, Ben-Gurion&#x2019;s primary function seems to be to filter out those very enemies by tightly controlling access to the state. This is true of all international airports, I suppose, as anyone who has undergone the humiliation of being scanned, fingerprinted, and photographed to be allowed entry into the United States post-9/11 can attest. In the modern world, airports have become a kind of identity directory: the place where we are most determinately defined, registered, and catalogued before being apportioned into separate queues, each according to nationality.<br><br>Still, Israel has, for obvious reasons, taken this process to new and unprecedented heights.

In 2006, when Palestinians were offered their first taste of a free and fair election, they voted overwhelmingly for the religious nationalists of Hamas over the more secular yet seemingly inept politicians of Fatah, the party founded by Yasir Arafat in 1958. Despite having promised to allow the Palestinians self-determination, Israel, the United States, and the European powers quickly decided that Hamas, whose founding charter refuses to recognize the state of Israel and whose militant wing, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, has been responsible for countless Israeli military and civilian deaths, would not be allowed to govern. Gaza, the sliver of fallow land that has become Hamas&#x2019;s de facto stronghold, was cut off from the outside world. International aid dried up and a plan was put in place to, as The New York Times put it, &#x201c;starve the Palestinian Authority of money and international connections&#x201d; to the point where new elections would have to be held. This resulted in a violent rift between Hamas and Fatah that split the Occupied Territories in two: the West Bank, governed by Fatah with the aid of Israel and the Western powers; and Gaza, ruled by Hamas and isolated from the rest of the world, a prison with one and a half million hungry, fuming inmates.<br><br>I wanted to visit the ruined village of Um al-Nasr, in northern Gaza, some miles away from lush Tel Aviv. A few months earlier, a number of villagers, including two toddlers, had drowned in what the press was calling a &#x201c;sewage tsunami.&#x201d; The deluge had been triggered by the collapse of a treatment facility just above the village that had been slowly and steadily leaking sewage. For months the villagers of Um al-Nasr had pleaded with Israeli authorities to allow the importation of the pumps, pipes, and filters necessary to stem the flow. But Israel, rattled by a ceaseless barrage of crudely constructed rockets launched daily from Gaza, some of which were&#x2014;in the sort of grim irony that can exist only in such a place&#x2014;constructed from old sewage pipes, refused. The villagers built an earthen embankment around what was fast becoming a giant lake of human waste. But the embankment would not hold. On the morning of March 27, 2007, while most of the villagers of Um al-Nasr slept, the embankment gave way. The village was inundated.<br><br>This is what we talk about when we talk about Gaza: that human beings&#x2014;men, women, children&#x2014;could literally drown in shit.<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;To visit the sites,&#x201d; I say.<br><br>It is not a satisfactory answer, and I am taken into a windowless room, where the question is repeated, this time by a slightly older officer. An hour passes, and a third officer walks in with the same question. &#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d;<br><br>Thereafter, the question is repeated&#x2014;in the sterile immigration office; in a smaller, even more sterile office inside the first office; in an even smaller office inside that office; and later, at the immigration queue, at the baggage claim, at customs&#x2014;until I come to think of &#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d; as a form of greeting.<br><br>All of this is understandable. I resent none of it. Though I am a citizen of the United States, I was born in Iran and have spent a great deal of time in countries that do not even recognize Israel&#x2019;s right to exist&#x2014;countries that, were I to have an Israeli stamp on my passport, would not allow me to enter their borders, would maybe even cart me off to jail. Israel has every reason to be cautious, considering the battering it as has received at the hands of people who look just like me.<br><br>The problem is not with Israel. The problem is with me, with the sum of my identities. My citizenship is American; my nationality, Iranian; my ethnicity, Persian; my culture, Middle Eastern; my religion, Muslim; my gender, male. All the multiple signifiers of my identity&#x2014;the things that make me who I am&#x2014;are in one way or another viewed as a threat to the endless procession of perfectly pleasant, perfectly reasonable immigration officers whose task it is to maintain a safe distance between people like them and people like me.<br><br>Even so, throughout the entire exercise, I could not help but think of the famed French theorist Ernest Renan, who once defined the nation as &#x201c;a group of people united in a mistaken view about the past and a hatred of their neighbors.&#x201d; Nowhere is that sentiment borne out more fully or with more force than among the nations scattered along the broad horizon of the Middle East. Perhaps it should come as no surprise, then, that the region in which nationalism arose so late, and so often through the will of others, is the region in which it is now being most unmistakably subsumed by the tide of globalization.<br>Globalization means many things to many people. Though the term itself is new, having entered our vocabulary only in the 1980s, the systemic social, economic, and cultural changes that the word conjures have been taking place for centuries. There is a compelling case to be made for considering the process of globalization to have begun when the first humans footslogged out of Africa in search of game and refuge and more temperate climates. The age of empires was in some ways the height of globalization; the Romans, Byzantines, Persians, and Mongols were able to cross-pollinate their trade, communication, and cultures across vast distances with fluidity and ease. The same could be said of the age of colonialism, in which the old imperial model of commercial relations among neighboring kingdoms was transformed into the more manageable, if less ethical, model of total economic domination of indigenous populations. And certainly no single force can be said to have had a greater impact on propelling globalization forward than religion, which has always sought to spread its message across the boundaries of borders, clans, and ethnicities. Simply put, globalization is not a new phenomenon.<br><br>In its contemporary usage, however, the term &#x201c;globalization&#x201d; refers to modern trends such as the expansion of international financial systems, the interconnectedness of national interests, the rise of global media and communication technologies like the Internet, the mass migration of peoples&#x2014;all taking place across the boundaries of sovereign nation-states. The simplest definition of modern globalization belongs to the Danish political philosophers Hans-Henrik Holm and Georg S�rensen: &#x201c;The intensification of economic, political, social and cultural relations across borders.&#x201d; But I prefer the sociologist Roland Robertson&#x2019;s view of globalization as &#x201c;a concept that refers both to the compression of the world and the intensification of consciousness of the world as a whole&#x201d; (italics mine).<br><br>Globalization, in other words, is not just about technological advancement and transnational relations. It is about one&#x2019;s sense of self in a world that is increasingly being viewed as a single space. The world has not changed as much as we have. Our idea of the self has expanded. How we identify ourselves as part of a social collective, how we conceive of our public spaces, how we interact with like-minded individuals, how we determine our religious and political leaders, even how we think about categories of religion and politics&#x2014;everything about how we define ourselves both as individuals and as members of a larger society is transformed in a globalized world because our sense of self is not constrained by territorial boundaries. And since the self is composed of multiple markers of identity&#x2014;nationality, class, gender, religion, ethnicity, and so on&#x2014;if one of those starts to give way (say, nationality), it is only natural that another (religion, ethnicity) would come to fill the vacuum.<br><br>For most of the last century, secular nationalism&#x2014;the political philosophy that places the nation-state at the center of collective identity&#x2014;has been the dominant marker of identity in much of the world, even in the developing world, whose leaders tend to view the creation of a sturdy national identity as the first step in its economic and political advancement. Nationalism begins, of course, with the idea of the nation, but the nation is not always so easy to define.<br><br>A nation is &#x201c;a community of common descent,&#x201d; writes Anthony Smith, the foremost theorist on the subject; bound together by a set of shared values and traditions, myths and historical memories, and often linked to some ancestral homeland: &#x201c;the place where &#x2018;our&#x2019; sages, saints, and heroes lived, worked, prayed, and fought.&#x201d; A state is the bureaucratic mechanism (i.e., government) necessary to organize and control a nation within territorial boundaries. A state has borders; it can be geographically defined. A nation is borderless; it is an &#x201c;imagined community,&#x201d; to borrow a much-borrowed phrase from Benedict Anderson. The only borders a nation has are those of inclusion and exclusion: who belongs and who does not.<br><br>In a state, membership is defined through citizenship. But membership in a nation requires some other measure of unity: the members must share the same traditions, speak the same language, worship the same god, or practice the same rituals. The modern state can be traced back only to the eighteenth century. But the nation has existed from the moment human populations began to organize themselves as families, clans, tribes, peoples. The Celts, the Aztecs, the Persians, the Jews, the Arabs&#x2014;all laid claim to a degree of &#x201c;nationhood,&#x201d; all possessed a sense of community, and all maintained links to an ancestral homeland long before they were absorbed into various states.<br><br>Think of the nation as a grand historical narrative&#x2014;both mythical and real&#x2014;written in the memories of generation after generation of a people. The state is the cover and binding that harnesses that narrative, creating a readable book. Thus, when we speak of the nation-state, we refer to the relatively new idea that a nation&#x2014;a community of common descent&#x2014;can be contained within the territorial or bureaucratic boundaries of a state. And when we speak of secular nationalism, we mean the even newer idea that the members of a nation-state should be bound together not by religious or ethnic affiliation but through a social contract among free and equal citizens.<br><br>When the nation-state was an autonomous, territorially bounded entity governing a community of people who shared some measure of cultural homogeneity&#x2014;as was the case throughout much of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries&#x2014;secular nationalism thrived. But globalization has changed everything. The rise of cosmopolitan cities such as New York, Paris, Amsterdam, London, and Hong Kong; the surge in mass migration, dual nationalities, and hyphenated identities; the ceaseless flow of peoples across state borders; all of these have made achieving anything like cultural homogeneity within territorial boundaries almost impossible. The more the world becomes deterritorialized, the more nationalism loses its place as the primary marker of collective identity. Just as a narrative cannot be truly contained within the bindings of a book, so has globalization put the lie to the idea that a nation can be truly bound by the geography of a state.</p><h2>Mindfulness Is Better Than Chocolate: A Practical Guide to Enhanced Focus and Lasting Happiness in a World of Distractions</h2><p><b>&#x201c;This book is better than chocolate!&#x201d;&#x2014;Tal Ben-Shahar, <i>New York Times </i>best-selling author of <i>Happier </i>and <i>Choose the Life You Want</i></b><br><br> Distractions are everywhere these days.

Going to school across the border in San Diego, and later to cooking school in Paris, she found plenty to love in the markets, quickly folding new ingredients into her repertoire. She also encountered some curious foods masquerading as authentic Mexican: cheddar cheese-stuffed quesadillas, tortilla chips drowning in still more cheese, and the ubiquitous everything-but-the-kitchen-sink overstuffed burritos. Where were the authentic, easy-to-prepare Mexican recipes she grew up with? The brightly flavored seafood ceviches bursting with freshness? The simple, slender burritos filled with nothing more than intensely flavorful braised meat and blistered chiles? The healthy salsas that come together in minutes but can transform a meal?<br> <p>In her vivacious, fresh voice, Marcela aims to invigorate America&#x2019;s taste for real Mexican food--dishes that can be accomplished on any busy weeknight but that still express the authentic flavors of her native cuisine. Her food is much like her, Mexican but influenced by other cultures.

Shumway (Wheaton College) takes a different tack, forgoing any exhaustive or systematic list of organisms and instead presenting an overall view of all the elements and processes that shape and define the many ecosystems found along the Atlantic coast. The book is organized and color coded by habitat types (e.g., rocky shores, salt marshes, tidal flats, sand dunes), allowing discussion of a wide range of topics that include geologic history, introduced species, past and present human impacts, and the adaptations of the myriad species occurring in these areas. Numerous sidebars provide additional detail, and the book is liberally illustrated with color photographs. Shumway has done an excellent job of seamlessly integrating these subjects, making this both an enjoyable read and an essential companion for exploring the seashore. <b>Summing Up:</b> Highly recommended.

Working as an art critic for the magazines <i>Arts</i>, <i>Arts Magazine</i> and, later, <i>Art International</i>, Judd regularly contributed reviews of contemporary art exhibitions between 1959 and 1965, but continued to write throughout his life on a broad range of subjects. In his reviews and essays, Judd discussed in detail the work of more than 500 artists showing in New York in the early and mid-1960s, and provided a critical account of this significant era of art in America. While addressing the social and political ramifications of art production, the writings frequently addressed the work of such artists as Jackson Pollock, Kazimir Malevich, Barnett Newman, Ad Reinhardt, Lee Bontecou, Yayoi Kusama, John Chamberlain, Dan Flavin, Kenneth Noland and Claes Oldenburg. Judd&#x2019;s essay "Specific Objects," first published in 1965, remains central to the analysis of the new art developed in the early 1960s. Other essays included in this publication are "Complaints I" (1969), "Complaints II" (1973) and his previously unpublished essay "Imperialism, Nationalism and Regionalism" (1975), all of which establish the polemical importance of Judd&#x2019;s writing.</p> <br><strong>Donald Judd</strong> (1928&#x2013;94) was born in Excelsior Springs, Missouri, and after having served in the United States Army, attended the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia, and Columbia University, New York, where he received a BS in Philosophy, cum laude, in 1953. Studying at the Art Students League, Judd began his artistic career as a painter and transitioned to three-dimensional work in the early 1960s. Throughout his lifetime, in his writings and his work, he advocated for the importance of art and the artist&#x2019;s role in society.</p><p>Donald Judd was born in 1928. Convinced that Abstract Expressionism had deteriorated into fakery, Judd began around 1960 to search for an art free of falsehood. In search of a greater simplicity and clarity, he evolved a formal vocabulary of identical rectangular units constructed of industrial materials. He died in 1994.Perhaps more than any other artist of his generation, Judd shaped the cultural discourse of his time- not only through his radical sculptures, but with his prolific writing on his peers.

Her son had gone to sea and her daughter had married a merchant of Valmouth, so she lived alone at Oak Farm. People said she had been some kind of great person in the foreign land she came from, and indeed the mage Ogion used to stop by Oak Farm to see her; but that didn&#x2019;t count for much, since Ogion visited all sorts of nobodies.<br> <br>She had a foreign name, but Flint had called her Goha, which is what they call a little white web-spinning spider on Gont. That name fit well enough, she being white-skinned and small and a good spinner of goat&#x2019;s-wool and sheep-fleece. So now she was Flint&#x2019;s widow, Goha, mistress of a flock of sheep and the land to pasture them, four fields, an orchard of pears, two tenants&#x2019; cottages, the old stone farmhouse under the oaks, and the family graveyard over the hill where Flint lay, earth in his earth.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve generally lived near tombstones,&#x201d; she said to her daughter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, Mother, come live in town with us!&#x201d; said Apple, but the widow would not leave her solitude.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe later, when there are babies and you&#x2019;ll need a hand,&#x201d; she said, looking with pleasure at her grey-eyed daughter. &#x201c;But not now. You don&#x2019;t need me. And I like it here.&#x201d;<br> <br>When Apple had gone back to her young husband, the widow closed the door and stood on the stone-flagged floor of the kitchen of the farmhouse. It was dusk, but she did not light the lamp, thinking of her own husband lighting the lamp: the hands, the spark, the intent, dark face in the catching glow. The house was silent.<br> <br>I used to live in a silent house, alone, she thought. I will do so again. She lighted the lamp.<br> <br>In a late afternoon of the first hot weather, the widow&#x2019;s old friend Lark came out from the village, hurrying along the dusty lane. &#x201c;Goha,&#x201d; she said, seeing her weeding in the bean patch, &#x201c;Goha, it&#x2019;s a bad thing. It&#x2019;s a very bad thing. Can you come?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; the widow said. &#x201c;What would the bad thing be?&#x201d;<br> <br>Lark caught her breath. She was a heavy, plain, middle-aged woman, whose name did not fit her body anymore. But once she had been a slight and pretty girl, and she had befriended Goha, paying no attention to the villagers who gossiped about that white-faced Kargish witch Flint had brought home; and friends they had been ever since.<br> <br>&#x201c;A burned child,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Whose?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tramps&#x2019;.&#x201d;<br> <br>Goha went to shut the farmhouse door, and they set off along the lane, Lark talking as they went. She was short of breath and sweating. Tiny seeds of the heavy grasses that lined the lane stuck to her cheeks and forehead, and she brushed at them as she talked. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve been camped in the river meadows all the month. A man, passed himself off as a tinker, but he&#x2019;s a thief, and a woman with him. And another man, younger, hanging around with them most of the time. Not working, any of &#x2019;em. Filching and begging and living off the woman. Boys from downriver were bringing them farmstuff to get at her. You know how it is now, that kind of thing. And gangs on the roads and coming by farms. If I were you, I&#x2019;d lock my door, these days. So this one, this younger fellow, comes into the village, and I was out in front of our house, and he says, &#x2018;The child&#x2019;s not well.&#x2019; I&#x2019;d barely seen a child with them, a little ferret of a thing, slipped out of sight so quick I wasn&#x2019;t sure it was there at all. So I said, &#x2018;Not well? A fever?&#x2019; And the fellow says, &#x2018;She hurt herself, lighting the fire,&#x2019; and then before I&#x2019;d got myself ready to go with him he&#x2019;d made off. Gone. And when I went out there by the river, the other pair was gone too. Cleared out. Nobody. All their traps and trash gone too. There was just their campfire, still smoldering, and just by it&#x2014;partly in it&#x2014;on the ground&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Lark stopped talking for several steps. She looked straight ahead, not at Goha.<br> <br>&#x201c;They hadn&#x2019;t even put a blanket over her,&#x201d; she said.<br> <br>She strode on.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;d been pushed into the fire while it was burning,&#x201d; she said. She swallowed, and brushed at the sticking seeds on her hot face. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d say maybe she fell, but if she&#x2019;d been awake she&#x2019;d have tried to save herself. They beat her and thought they&#x2019;d killed her, I guess, and wanted to hide what they&#x2019;d done to her, so they&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>She stopped again, went on again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe it wasn&#x2019;t him. Maybe he pulled her out. He came to get help for her, after all. It must have been the father. I don&#x2019;t know. It doesn&#x2019;t matter. Who&#x2019;s to know? Who&#x2019;s to care? Who&#x2019;s to care for the child? Why do we do what we do?&#x201d;<br> <br>Goha asked in a low voice, &#x201c;Will she live?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She might,&#x201d; Lark said. &#x201c;She might well live.&#x201d;<br> <br>After a while, as they neared the village, she said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know why I had to come to you. Ivy&#x2019;s there. There&#x2019;s nothing to be done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I could go to Valmouth, for Beech.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing he could do. It&#x2019;s beyond . . . beyond help. I got her warm. Ivy&#x2019;s given her a potion and a sleeping charm. I carried her home. She must be six or seven but she didn&#x2019;t weigh what a two-year-old would. She never really waked. But she makes a sort of gasping. . . . I know there isn&#x2019;t anything you can do. But I wanted you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to come,&#x201d; Goha said. But before they entered Lark&#x2019;s house, she shut her eyes and held her breath a moment in dread.<br> <br>Lark&#x2019;s children had been sent outdoors, and the house was silent. The child lay unconscious on Lark&#x2019;s bed. The village witch, Ivy, had smeared an ointment of witch hazel and heal-all on the lesser burns, but had not touched the right side of the face and head and the right hand, which had been charred to the bone. She had drawn the rune Pirr above the bed, and left it at that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you do anything?&#x201d; Lark asked in a whisper.<br> <br>Goha stood looking down at the burned child. Her hands were still. She shook her head.<br> <br>&#x201c;You learned healing, up on the mountain, didn&#x2019;t you?&#x201d; Pain and shame and rage spoke through Lark, begging for relief.<br> <br>&#x201c;Even Ogion couldn&#x2019;t heal this,&#x201d; the widow said.<br> <br>Lark turned away, biting her lip, and wept. Goha held her, stroking her grey hair. They held each other.<br> <br>The witch Ivy came in from the kitchen, scowling at the sight of Goha. Though the widow cast no charms and worked no spells, it was said that when she first came to Gont she had lived at Re Albi as a ward of the mage, and that she knew the Archmage of Roke, and no doubt had foreign and uncanny powers. Jealous of her prerogative, the witch went to the bed and busied herself beside it, making a mound of something in a dish and setting it afire so that it smoked and reeked while she muttered a curing charm over and over. The rank herbal smoke made the burned child cough and half rouse, flinching and shuddering. She began to make a gasping noise, quick, short, scraping breaths. Her one eye seemed to look up at Goha.<br> <br>Goha stepped forward and took the child&#x2019;s left hand in hers. She spoke in her own language. &#x201c;I served them and I left them,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;I will not let them have you.&#x201d;<br> <br>The child stared at her or at nothing, trying to breathe, and trying again to breathe, and trying again to breathe.</p><h2>You Can Be Emotionally Free</h2><p>It's a beautiful book, and I hope it reaches a million hearts!"

This swift passage set a world record that went unbroken for more than a century. Upon arrival in San Francisco, <em>Flying Cloud</em> became an enduring symbol of a young nation's frontier spirit. Illustrated with original maps and charts as well as historical photographs, David Shaw's compelling narrative captures the drama of this maritime adventure. </p></p><p>In the early days of the California gold rush, it took more than 200 days for a ship to travel from New York to San Francisco, a voyage of more than 16,000 miles. In 1851, however, a clipper called the <i>Flying Cloud</i> made the same journey in only 89 days, a headline-grabbing world record that the <i>Cloud</i> itself beat three years later (and that would not then be broken until 1989).<p> The <i>Flying Cloud</i>'s achievement was remarkable under any terms. But, writes David W. Shaw, it was all the more unusual because its navigator was a woman, Eleanor Creesy, who had been studying oceanic currents, weather phenomena, and astronomy since her girlhood in Marblehead, Massachusetts. With her husband, ship captain Josiah Perkins Creesy, she logged many thousands of miles on the ocean, traveling around the world carrying passengers and goods. In the wake of their record-setting transit from New York to California, Eleanor and Josiah became instant celebrities. But their fame was short-lived and their story quickly forgotten. Josiah died in 1871, <i>Flying Cloud</i> burned to the waterline in 1874, and Eleanor lived far from the sea until her death in 1900. </p><p> Though spotty in its documentation and full of invented dialog, <i>Flying Cloud</i> is a spirited and capable reconstruction of the clipper's voyage, and an interesting glimpse into the days of the tall ships. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>David W. Shaw is the author of <em>Daring the Sea</em> and <em>Inland Passage.</em> An expert sailor in his own right, Shaw also writes for <em>Offshore </em> magazine, <em>Sail, Cruising World,</em> and <em>Lakeland Boating.</em> He lives in New Jersey and sails in Maine.</p></p><h2>Betty: The Story of Betty MacDonald, Author of The Egg and I</h2><p>Highly educated and raised as a lady, Betty Bard in 1927 married a man she barely knew. The newlyweds immediately started a chicken ranch in the remote American Northwest, and here Betty had to contend with a difficult husband, loneliness, pregnancy, primitive neighbors, and thousands of chickens. This was the stuff of her first book and the beginnings of a unique writer: in 1945 she published 'The Egg and I', a lightly fictionalised and very funny account of her life as a chicken farmer. The book was an immediate success, selling a million copies in less than a year, and was eventually translated into over thirty languages. A Hollywood movie of the book appeared two years later and at least eight further movies based on the popular 'Egg and I' characters Ma and Pa Kettle were to follow. <p>In the decade following, Betty wrote a number of highly popular children's books, 'Mrs Piggle-Wiggle' being the best known, and three more semi-autobiographical works. Her four comic memoirs of a life in the West and Northwest range from a rough mining community in Montana to the lush Olympic Peninsula and the bright lights of big city Seattle, and her life may even be viewed as a paradigm of early twentieth-century American experience: pioneering, homesteading, the Great Depression, war, and finally prosperity. </p><p> To a great degree Betty's life is in her work, even allowing for its fictional elements and humorous exaggeration. But questions remain for every fan of Betty's books. What really happened? What happened to Betty in the end? What became of Betty's family? Those questions are answered here.</p></p><p>Words can't describe how excited I was to see this biography of Betty MacDonald...It was fascinating to learn the 'story-behind-the-story' of Betty's books--especially 'Egg'...Fans of Betty, rejoice! This is the book for you.&nbsp;<i>-- Amazon reader</i><br>...I was pleasantly surprised to find Anne Wellman's book on Kindle Unlimited. It provides interesting additional information on Betty and her family and reveals some darker aspects of her life and character.&nbsp;<i>--Goodreads</i></p><h2>If You Want to Make God Laugh</h2><p><b>From the author of the beloved <i>Hum If You Don't Know the Words</i> comes a rich, unforgettable story of three unique women in post-Apartheid South Africa who are brought together in their darkest time and discover the ways that love can transcend the strictest of boundaries.</b><br><br>In a squatter camp on the outskirts of Johannesburg, seventeen-year-old Zodwa lives in desperate poverty, under the shadowy threat of a civil war and a growing AIDS epidemic. Eight months pregnant, Zodwa carefully guards secrets that jeopardize her life.<br><br>Across the country, wealthy socialite Ruth appears to have everything her heart desires, but it's what she can't have that leads to her breakdown. Meanwhile, in Zaire, a disgraced former nun, Delilah, grapples with a past that refuses to stay buried. When these personal crises send both middle-aged women back to their rural hometown to heal, the discovery of an abandoned newborn baby upends everything, challenging their lifelong beliefs about race, motherhood, and the power of the past.<br><br>As the mystery surrounding the infant grows, the complicated lives of Zodwa, Ruth, and Delilah become inextricably linked. What follows is a mesmerizing look at family and identity that asks: How far will the human heart go to protect itself and the ones it loves?</p><p><b>Bianca Marais </b>is the author of <i>Hum If You Don't Know the Words</i>.

She trails it until the sandy path dips suddenly, revealing a squat hut nestled in the grassland below. A woman sits waiting at the threshold. She's hunched over like a question mark, her headdress of white beads partially obscuring her face. A leopard skin is draped over her shoulders and the sight of it reassures Zodwa; the gold-and-black-spotted pelt ibhayi signifies the nyanga is a healer of great power.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The woman chews tobacco, which she spits out when Zodwa reaches her. "What took you so long?" she gripes, rising up on arthritic knees.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"How did you know I was coming?" Zodwa herself hadn't known she'd be making the journey until the early hours of that morning.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The ancestors told me." The nyanga holds out her palm.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zodwa reaches into her bra and withdraws a few crumpled notes. They are everything she has. "How much will it be?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The nyanga's knobbly hand shoots out and snatches it all away before Zodwa can protest. She disappears into the gloom and beckons for Zodwa to follow. Inside, it looks like a regular hut with its circular walls, thatch roof, and dung floor, but Zodwa knows it's imbued with the spirits of the clan members who have gone before; the ndumba is a sacred place.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The healer motions for Zodwa to sit on the floor. "How many years do you have, child?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm seventeen," Zodwa replies. "Almost eighteen." She knows she looks younger and blames it on her rounded cheekbones, which lend her face a childish quality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The healer's eyes inspect Zodwa from head to toe and Zodwa flushes, knowing that the old woman disapproves. Her pleated black skirt is hemmed to just below her knees, but still it's too short for traditional wear. The white blouse is a fraction too tight, but this is because Zodwa has outgrown it, not out of choice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The nyanga holds up a gourd. "Undlela zimhlophe," she explains before swallowing its contents. She limps to her mat and kneels down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It's past midday and the powerful root has to be consumed on an empty stomach so that it can induce the lucid and prophetic dreams that will help her hear the ancestors' voices. The old woman must be hungry. Zodwa's hungry too, though not because she's been fasting. Her hunger isn't the temporary kind that will soon be satiated; it's the gnawing kind that takes up residence in a stomach that has been empty for too long. It's a hunger born of poverty.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The nyanga begins groaning while rocking back and forth. The smell of impepho burning saturates the air, and the sage fills Zodwa's lungs with every breath she takes, dulling her senses with its hypnotic scent. The hut, darkened and warm, reminds her of home. At least, the home she'd lived in with her grandmother in KwaZulu before she joined her mother in the sqatter camp earlier in the year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her grandmother had been reluctant, at first, to relinquish Zodwa to Leleti and considering everything that had happened, Zodwa couldn't blame her. Her gogo had lost her only son, Zodwa's father, to a mining accident in the City of Gold, and then Zodwa's eighteen-year-old brother, Dumisa, disappeared less than a year after leaving for Johannesburg when Zodwa was seven.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Be very careful, my child," Zodwa's gogo had cautioned her before she left the village for the township. "Bad things happen in the city. Its gods are very hungry and must be appeased. Don't become one of the sacrifices made to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You must study hard, mzukulu wami," her grandmother had continued. "You must be brave but do not try to be as brave as your brother was. If your light shines too bright, someone will always seek to extinguish it. And do not give in to temptations. The city makes girls forget their virtue and modesty. It makes them behave in wanton ways. Remember, my child, that a good bride price comes from respect."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zodwa had tried to follow her gogo's advice, she really had, but the township had awakened something in her. It was as if the city's electricity had jump-started her body, and no matter how much she tried to keep her thoughts pure, they simply wouldn't cooperate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>There will be no good lobolo now. There will be no bride price at all since no offer of marriage has come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zodwa's thoughts are interrupted by the nyanga rising from her place on the floor. The old woman winces as she stands up on stiff knees and shuffles over to where Zodwa sits.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Her voice is hoarse. "The amadlozi are angry with you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It is what Zodwa most feared hearing. No one wants to incite the wrath of the ancestors. "Because of the baby?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The old woman shoots Zodwa a shrewd look. "It is not the baby the ancestors speak of."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zodwa hangs her head, the familiar shame slithering its way up her spine.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What did you dream the last time you slept?" the healer asks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It isn't difficult to answer, as the nightmare has stayed with Zodwa all day. "I dreamt I was being chased."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"By what?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zodwa shivers inwardly. "Two white owls. Their wingspan stretched across the sky, blocking out the sun."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The healer's frown deepens. "And then what happened?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I thought they were going to kill me, but it wasn't me they wanted."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What then?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The baby. They snatched it from me and flew away."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The nyanga nods and sighs. "It is as the ancestors have said. You wage a war with yourself by following the wrong path. You have only yourself to blame that you are now expecting this child who will bring you even greater misery."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What can I do?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"About the baby . . . only you can decide." The nyanga shrugs. "I can give you herbs to try to take care of it. About the other matter . . . the ancestors say that you must walk the path that is intended for you. Only then will you find peace."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Zodwa can't think of that now. Any peace she could wish for in that regard would only follow a termination of her pregnancy, which is the more urgent of her problems. "I will take the herbs."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It may already be too late." The nyanga's face is inscrutable as she turns and hobbles to the table laid out with dozens of pots and baskets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She moves assuredly between them, picking sprigs from some and roots from others, as she sets about making her infusion, adding water to a three-legged cast-iron pot and emptying the ingredients into it, before setting it over the coals in the middle of the room. Stirring it occasionally, she brings the mixture to a boil and then removes it, straining the liquid through a cloth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Drink," she says, handing Zodwa a gourd filled with an acrid-smelling brew.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everything makes Zodwa nauseous these days but the concoction is especially vile. She struggles to drink it, gagging a few times and almost bringing it up.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When she's swallowed the last drop and wiped her mouth, the nyanga takes the gourd back. "Now we wait."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>chapter two</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Delilah</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>22 April 1994</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Goma, Zaire</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The letter that changed everything arrived as Xavier and I were coaxing the generator back to life after the power had gone out again. Considering that the orphanage housed more than two hundred children, the lack of electricity for lighting and heating was bad enough, but not being able to pump water out of the borehole was a potential crisis.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone's nerves were already on edge after the plane carrying the Rwandan and Burundian presidents was shot down two weeks before. Thousands of Rwandans were fleeing for their lives, the Tutsis streaming across the border into Zaire. We were all on full alert and had to be ready to make a run for it if the Rwandan military sent incursions across the border. It seemed more and more likely that it would.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As it was, the generator was useless without fuel, every last drop of which had been poured into the Land Rovers' tanks in case we needed to evacuate. I'd had to siphon off some of it for the machine but the cantankerous beast was still refusing to accept the offering and start.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I looked to the horizon at the sun that would soon be setting. Xavier couldn't work in the dark, so there wasn't much time left. I was about to start sieving leftover sunflower oil through a sock, to serve as lubricant in case Xavier needed it, when I heard my name being called.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I turned to see Doctor grinning wildly and running at me while waving something in his hand. Everyone stepped back as he made his way through the playground. He was like Moses parting the Red Sea. "Granny! Granny!" he shouted.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That's how all the children naturally addressed anyone over forty and, being closer to sixty, I more than qualified. When I was much younger and starting out as an aid worker across the border, I'd been called "Mother." It had felt like a slap in the face to be named that, as if they were mocking me for my childless state, which of course they weren't. All those countries and missions later, after all the thousands of children I'd tended, I'd finally grown used to it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As Doctor ran at me, I should have chided him for his recklessness around the machinery but I didn't. His joy at being alive was so pure that I found myself favoring him, even granting him amnesty from the rules all the others were expected to live by. My partiality for the boy wasn't solely based on his positive outlook on life; I'd delivered him five years before.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite having had no child-birthing training, I'd stepped in when all the other midwives had refused to help his HIV-positive mother, back when HIV was so rare that it was considered more black magic than a disease. His mother had gone into labor a few weeks premature after almost being stoned to death as she was chased from her village. I'd refused to allow her to go through another ordeal alone.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Coached over satellite telephone by a Doctors Without Borders obstetrician, I'd kitted up in a makeshift kind of hazmat suit before helping bring Doctor into the world. We were lucky. Despite his mother's health issues, it had been a textbook birth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She'd cradled him to her chest for an hour afterward, too weak to sit up but too fierce to allow me to take him from her. She held him while I held her, my gloved hand over her bare one, which was resting on his scrawny buttocks.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"He will be a great man, this one," she said, smiling weakly. "I name him Doctor." It was the highest honor she could think to bestow on him. It depressed me, given that the medical profession had been able to do nothing for her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'd often wondered since then if a child could be inoculated in the womb against the horror of the world through the power of its mother's love; if that love could infuse joy into a child even when her presence couldn't. God knows, if ever there was a woman who wanted to live to raise her child, who'd fought like a hellion just so that he could be born, it was she. She told me it was because he was the only thing in her life that was truly hers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I have a letter for you, Granny," Doctor now said, smiling proudly as he handed the envelope across.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>He was painfully thin and out of breath from the short sprint. Breathing should never sound that way. As though lungs are blades and air is something solid to be chopped up. Still, Doctor had lived three years longer than any of us had expected and he accepted his condition stoically.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you, Doctor. You've done a good job getting it to me," I said solemnly as I reached out and squeezed his shoulder. He beamed at the contact. "Could you put it in my pocket?" I asked, indicating my dirty hands and turning so he could tuck the envelope into the back of my trousers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It was after midnight when Xavier and I finally parted ways, exhausted yet triumphant. The generator was running again. Disaster had been staved off for another day. Seeking refuge in my room, I made my way to the narrow bed and lifted the mosquito net to sit on the cotton sheet I�d paid such an exorbitant price for.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The view from there was of my makeshift wardrobe, which consisted of a pole balanced between two columns of raised cinder blocks. The few items of clothing I owned were hung up while my empty rucksack sat propped in a corner of the room. Amelia, the UN aid coordinator, would've had a fit if she'd seen it, since we'd been given strict instructions to be ready to evacuate at a moment's notice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Where did you flee to, though, when you were already in purgatory and surrounded by hell on all sides? And how was running an option when it would mean saving yourself while abandoning hundreds of defenseless children?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I lit the candle on my bedside table, pushing away thoughts of the threat across the border just as the light pushed away the darkness, and bent down to undo the laces of my boots. We usually wore flip-flops because of the heat, but they'd been banned that week because it was impossible to run in them. Boots made your feet sweat, but they wouldn't trip you up or twist your ankle if you needed to sprint to safety.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Once I'd kicked off my shoes, I pulled the wrinkled envelope from my pocket. I held a candle up to the postmark, careful not to let the flame lick at the paper. The letter had originated in Johannesburg, though the date was too smudged to read. There was no return address, but I suddenly recognized the handwriting even though I hadn't seen it in many years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My pulse quickened as I set the candle holder down and slipped my finger under the envelope's flap. I wriggled it until the seal tore and found a single sheet of onionskin paper inside. When I unfolded it, a Polaroid fluttered to the floor. I bent to pick it up and when I flipped it over, the face I beheld made my heart stutter. Setting the photo aside, I held the page to the light.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dearest Delilah,</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I pray that this letter finds its way safely into your hands. Please forgive me for being both the bearer of bad news, and for having to convey it in this impersonal manner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The page trembled in my grasp as impossible words marched across its landscape: Father Daniel . . . rectory . . . robbery . . . Joburg General Hospital . . . coma . . . fighting for his life . . . I had to read it three times before I understood its full import. The past was beckoning and I had no choice but to answer its siren call.</p></p><h2>Agathe: Or, The Forgotten Sister (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><b>From the author of 'A Man without Qualities,' a novel about spirituality in the modern world.</b><br><b><br></b><br>Agathe is the sister of Ulrich, the so-called &#x201c;man without qualities&#x201d; who is the major character in Robert Musil&#x2019;s great, unfinished novel of that name. Ulrich is intellectual and skeptical and rebellious and yet for all that rule-bound, held hostage by his attraction to the systematic, even if every existing system&#x2014;political, ethical, metaphysical&#x2014;strikes this onetime mathematician as fundamentally suspect. When, however, after many years Ulrich and his younger sister, Agathe, reunite over the bier of their dead father, a celebrated lawyer, both siblings are electrified. They are, for one thing, almost each other&#x2019;s spitting image, while Agathe, who has just separated from her husband, is even more resistant to any kind of status quo than her brother. Engaging in a series of ever more intense and questioning &#x201c;holy conversations,&#x201d; brother and sister progressively enlarge the boundaries of sexuality, sensuality, and identity, seeking to arrive at a new conception of reality that they are sure lies within each other to discover.<br>Musil&#x2019;s <i>Agathe, or the Forgotten Sister</i> is one of the most unexpected and breathtaking adventures of twentieth-century fiction, while Joel Agee&#x2019;s new English translation captures all the nuance of Musil&#x2019;s famously acute and penetrating style.</p><p><b>Robert Musil</b> (1880&#x2013;1942) is the author of <i>The Confusions of Young T�rless</i>, <i>Five Women</i>, <i>The Man Without Qualities</i>, and <i>The Posthumous Papers of a Living Author</i>.

In this lively history of bakers, dietary crusaders, and social reformers, Aaron Bobrow-Strain shows us that what we think about the humble, puffy loaf says a lot about who we are and what we want our society to look like.<br> <i>&nbsp;</i><br> <i>White Bread</i> teaches us that when Americans debate what one should eat, they are also wrestling with larger questions of race, class, immigration, and gender. As Bobrow-Strain traces the story of bread, from the first factory loaf to the latest gourmet <i>pain au levain,</i> he shows how efforts to champion &#x201c;good food&#x201d; reflect dreams of a better society&#x2014;even as they reinforce stark social hierarchies.<br> &nbsp;<br> In the early twentieth century, the factory-baked loaf heralded a bright new future, a world away from the hot, dusty, &#x201c;dirty&#x201d; bakeries run by immigrants. Fortified with vitamins, this bread was considered the original &#x201c;superfood&#x201d; and even marketed as patriotic&#x2014;while food reformers painted white bread as a symbol of all that was wrong with America.<br> &nbsp;<br> The history of America&#x2019;s one-hundred-year-long love-hate relationship with white bread reveals a lot about contemporary efforts to change the way we eat. Today, the alternative food movement favors foods deemed ethical and environmentally correct to eat, and fluffy industrial loaves are about as far from slow, local, and organic as you can get. Still, the beliefs of early twentieth-century food experts and diet gurus, that getting people to eat a certain food could restore the nation&#x2019;s decaying physical, moral, and social fabric, will sound surprisingly familiar. Given that open disdain for &#x201c;unhealthy&#x201d; eaters and discrimination on the basis of eating habits grow increasingly acceptable, <i>White Bread</i> is a timely and important examination of what we talk about when we talk about food.</p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, March 2012</strong>: It's in, it's out, it's good for you, it's bad for you: over the last hundred years, bread has gone from industrial-strength cure-all to nutritionless fluff, and every place in between. <i>White Bread</i> is Aaron Bobrow-Strain's look at the central place of bread, not just on the American table but also in its discussions about morality, class, race, and the environment. Bobrow-Strain takes readers from the immigrant-run bakeries of the 1900s, which were associated with unsafe bread, to the shining promise of industrially-made loaves that could bolster Americans against communism, to the brown-bread revolution of the '70s and '80s. Along the way, Bobrow-Strain shows that the history of bread was leavened with good intentions and ironclad convictions--many of which succumbed to the ageless hobgoblin of unintended consequences. Entertaining for fans of history, food, and the history of food, <i>White Bread</i> reveals yet another facet to the ever-complicated world of what we eat. <i>--Darryl Campbell</i><p><b>Aaron Bobrow-Strain</b> is associate professor of politics at Whitman College in Washington. He writes and teaches on the politics of the global food system.

She documents the shocking toll of a public-health disaster-300,000 deaths a year in the U.S. and Europe from the effects of pollution-and asks why we remain silent. For Davis, the issue is personal: Pollution is what killed many in her family and forced some of the others, survivors of the 1948 smog emergency in Donora, Pennsylvania, to live out their lives with impaired health. She describes that episode and also makes startling revelations about how the deaths from the London smog of 1952 were falsely attributed to influenza; how the oil companies and auto manufacturers fought for decades to keep lead in gasoline, while knowing it caused brain damage; and many other battles. <i>When Smoke Ran Like Water</i> makes a devastating case for change.</p><p><b>Devra Davis</b>, Ph.D., M.P.H., is the Director of the Center for Environmental Oncology at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute and Professor of Epidemiology, Graduate School of Public Health. She was appointed by President Clinton to the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board in 1994 and also served as Scholar in Residence at the National Academy of Science. She works in Pittsburgh, and lives in Washington, D.C. She is married to Richard D. Morgenstern and has two children and two grandchildren.Davis, one of the world's leading epidemiologists and researchers on environmentally linked illness, writes about her lifelong battle against environmental pollution in strong prose, underlined with some horrifying stories. With a special emphasis on air pollution and its long-term effects, Davis anecdotally talks about some of the most infamous smogs and fogs of all time, including the Donora Fog (October 26, 1948) that left a small zinc-factory town in Pennsylvania blanketed in a thick, toxic fog for over a week. "Within days, nearly half the town would fall ill" and within one 24-hour period 18 people had died. She argues that these incidents are underreported because the industries responsible for the pollutants are often powerful corporations or the major employer in these small towns. Research into the long-term effects of pollution, such as breast and testicular cancer, reveals that people in the Northeast (including Long Island and Connecticut) and in California have a higher incidence of serious illnesses. Most importantly, Davis brings to the fore the long-lasting effects of growing up and living in a polluted atmosphere, clearly demonstrating that "people living in areas with the dirtiest air had the highest risk of dying." She sounds the warning bell loud and clear: the threat to public health is real. This is an enlightening, engrossing read (with an intro by Gaynor, a leading oncologist at the Weill-Cornell Medical College in New York City), which should be on the shelf of anyone who cares about the environment and wants to learn more about policy, health and politics; Davis weaves all of these together with grace.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Sacred Seed</h2><p><p>Inspired by physicist and environmental leader Dr. Vandana Shiva, this collection of essays draw on the wisdom of ancient and modern traditions to remind readers of the profound sacredness of the seed&#x2014;how in its purity, it is the source and renewal of all of life.

Like many industrial cities, Lawrence entered a downward economic spiral in the decades after World War II due to deindustrialization and suburbanization. The arrival of tens of thousands of Puerto Ricans and Dominicans in the late twentieth century brought new life to the struggling city, but settling in Lawrence was fraught with challenges. Facing hostility from their neighbors, exclusion from local governance, inadequate city services, and limited job prospects, Latinos fought and organized for the right to make a home in the city. <br><br>In this book, Llana Barber interweaves the histories of urban crisis in U.S. cities and imperial migration from Latin America. Pushed to migrate by political and economic circumstances shaped by the long history of U.S. intervention in Latin America, poor and working-class Latinos then had to reckon with the segregation, joblessness, disinvestment, and profound stigma that plagued U.S. cities during the crisis era, particularly in the Rust Belt.

Through an in-depth empirical analysis of select global industries, the book demonstrates how the main locations of labor unrest have shifted from country to country together with shifts in the geographical location of production. It shows how the main sites of labor unrest have shifted over time together with the rise or decline of new leading sectors of capitalist development and demonstrates that labor movements have been deeply embedded (as both cause and effect) in world political dynamics. Over the history of the modern labor movement, the book isolates what is truly novel about the contemporary global crisis of labor movements. Arguing against the view that this is a terminal crisis, the book concludes by exploring the likely forms that emergent labor movements will take in the twenty-first century.</p><p>The book analyzes the global dynamics of labor movements, introducing a major new database on labor unrest events worldwide from 1870 to 1996. The book&#39;s purpose is to assess the contemporary crisis of labor movements, but it argues that to do so effectively labor movements need to be studied in a longer historical and wider geographical framework than is normally done. Key themes include the relationship between labor unrest and capital mobility in various global industries (automobiles, textiles, semiconductors, and service industries) and the inter-relationship between world labor unrest and world politics over the past century."Beverly Silver's empirically rich and powerfully argued book provides the kind of historical and class analysis that has been so badly lacking in the globalization literature. Bravo!" Leo Pantich, York University <p>"By broadening the geography for understanding labor struggles, Silver shows us that these are going strong in many parts of the world even as they have weakened and fizzled in the North Atlantic. A great contribution to contemporary debates about the politics of contestation." Saskia Sassen, The University of Chicago </p><p>"Beverly Silver's new book is a challenge to political economists and economic sociologists and even to those historians who still care about capitalism trajectories. Avoiding the deceptive poles of both "race to the bottom" pessimism and liberal optimism, availing herself of both an immense database and of deep historical knowledge, Silver traces the recurring rises and declines of the world labor movement along two dimensions of capital mobility: its spatial displacement and its shift to new product lines--both in response to labor militancy. Sweeping and detailed, ponderous but readable, comparative and historical, this book takes the political economy of world systems to a new level."

Revelations such as Climategate, or debates about the safety of the MMR vaccine, have dented our confidence in science.</p> <p>In this provocative new book Harry Collins seeks to redeem scientific expertise, and reasserts science&#x2019;s special status. Despite the messy realities of day-to-day scientific endeavor, he emphasizes the superior moral qualities of science, dismissing the dubious &#x201c;default&#x201d; expertise displayed by many of those outside the scientific community. Science, he argues, should serve as an example to ordinary citizens of how to think and act, and not the other way round.</p></p><p><b>Harry Collins</b> is Distinguished Research Professor of Sociology and Director of the Centre for the Study of Knowledge, Expertise and Science (KES) at Cardiff University. He is a Fellow of the British Academy. He has written 17 previous books including the well-known Golem series on science. Harry Collins is continuing his research on the nature of scientific knowledge, on the analysis of expertise and on the sociology of gravitational wave detection.<p>"To the extent we might come to witness a reaction against the fallen idol of everyone thinking they are an expert, <i>Are We All Scientific Experts Now?</i> might come to be a classic, a Gangnam Style shot across the STS bow."<br><i><b>Metascience</b></i><br><br>"In his remarkable manifesto, sociologist Harry Collins, a major voice in the field of science studies, answers the provocative question presented in the books title: <i>Are We All Scientific Experts Now?</i> Collins starts out by outlining sciences fall from grace in the publics eye and by presenting a tongue-in-cheek caricature of scientific expertise based on the zeitgeist he holds responsible for the distortions."<br><i><b>Physics Today</b></i><br><br>"A valuable contribution to the ways in which we ascribe value to expertise ... Although Collins convincingly answers the books title question with a resounding no, what is most interesting and refreshing about his analysis is that it enables people holding different kinds of expertise to recognise their role in scientific debate."<br><i><b>LSE Review of Books<br></b></i><br>"Certainly a book for those who are interested in science and its role in society. For those who are curious about how scientists tackle problems and why they do often have the answers, it should prove illuminating."<br><i><b>Times Higher Education</b></i><br><br>"This brave, thoughtful little book should be sent to every newspaper editor. Collins doesnt write with Ben Goldacres righteous anger, but his careful, nuanced scholarship is just as persuasive."<br><i><b>Seamus OMahony, Dublin Review of Books</b></i><br><br>"Masterful new book."<br><i><b>Mother Jones</b></i><br><br>"Brief book with a very high level argument relying a lot on his experience... this kind of nuanced, important thinking about science and expertise is a wonderful gift from Collins that I truly hope we don't squander."<br><i><b>Stark Reality - Todd I. Stark</b></i><br><br>''I read this short book with admiration - an analysis by a social scientist which (unlike much of that genre) should resonate with most actual researchers.''<br><b><i>Martin Rees, Astronomer Royal and Former President of the Royal Society</i></b><br> </p><p>''Packed into a slim polemic that succinctly yet movingly distills years of painstaking research into expertise, Harry Collins delivers an immensely rich book-- a thorough cultural and intellectual analysis of why attitudes towards towards scientific expertise have changed, and why a new view of them needs to be adopted, to preserve society. Readers who are new to Collins's ideas will find come away with a fresh take on explosive controversies, including Climategate and anti-vaccination campaigns. Long time readers of Collins will be amazed at how accessible his technical arguments are and the big impact that's made by seeing them integrated into a gripping, short-form narrative.''<br><b><i>Evan Selinger, Rochester Institute of Technology</i></b><br><br>"[O]ne of the best examples of practical philosophy of science for regular people I have encountered."<br><i><b>ScienceBlogs</b></i><br><br> </p> &nbsp;</p><h2>Just Research: Preparing for Practice (Aspen Coursebook)</h2><p><p><em>Just Research </em>provides students with the information and skills that will enable them to do thorough and cost-effective research as soon as they enter into practice.

Maps of topical spaces help us visualize the extent and structure of our collective knowledge; they reveal bursts of activity, pathways of ideas, and borders that beg to be crossed. This book, from the author of <i>Atlas of Science</i>, describes the power of topical maps, providing readers with principles for visualizing knowledge and offering as examples forty large-scale and more than 100 small-scale full-color maps. </p><p>Today, data literacy is becoming as important as language literacy. Well-designed visualizations can rescue us from a sea of data, helping us to make sense of information, connect ideas, and make better decisions in real time. In <i>Atlas of Knowledge</i>, leading visualization expert Katy B�rner makes the case for a systems science approach to science and technology studies and explains different types and levels of analysis. Drawing on fifteen years of teaching and tool development, she introduces a theoretical framework meant to guide readers through user and task analysis; data preparation, analysis, and visualization; visualization deployment; and the interpretation of science maps. To exemplify the framework, the Atlas features striking and enlightening new maps from the popular &#x201c;Places &amp; Spaces: Mapping Science&#x201d; exhibit that range from &#x201c;Key Events in the Development of the Video Tape Recorder&#x201d; to &#x201c;Mobile Landscapes: Location Data from Cell Phones for Urban Analysis&#x201d; to &#x201c;Literary Empires: Mapping Temporal and Spatial Settings of Victorian Poetry&#x201d; to &#x201c;Seeing Standards: A Visualization of the Metadata Universe.&#x201d; She also discusses the possible effect of science maps on the practice of science.</p></p><p>Katy B�rner is Victor H.

It is a highlyintuitive tool that allows a quick, snapshot evaluation of a businessidea. It is calculated to measure the worthiness of an idea beforecritical resources are tapped or engaged. By scoring your idea withthis index, you will identify its strengths and weaknesses. You willknow whether your business will fly, how to make it fly higher, andhow to add the weight necessary to drive it successfully into themarket so you win your share of the gold.</p> <p>Over the past seven years, Columbia University, GeorgetownUniversity, the University of Maryland, the University of Denver, theUniversity of North Dakota, and The George Washington Universityhave periodically offered a course in entrepreneurship that requiresstudents to bring their business ideas to class. The essence of thecourse was also taught 16 times in Russia to senior executives ofvarious petroleum companies, all by means of a real-time languagetranslator and all under the aegis of Columbia University. This bookdescribes the distilled synthesis of a key element of those courses: acomprehensive, common-sense tool that can quickly assess the viabilityand feasibility of an idea at the very earliest moments of eachcourse. In each course, the students tried to launch their ideas intoreal live companies. That tool, which became known first as the"Launch Aperture" and later as the "Innovator's Scorecard," is thebasis of this book. We needed an up-front device that wouldinstantly align and screen the ideas for the students to manipulateduring the course. Did it work? Absolutely. Students were bringingin checks for tens of thousands of dollars from customers longbefore the business plans were written. In one case, the studentsclosed on $456 million for the support of their classroom project.</p> <p>Anyone who uses the Innovator's Scorecard--from a first-timeat-bat owner to a repeat entrepreneur to a lawyer to a seasonedinvestor--can tell immediately whether an idea has the silhouetteof a success story. Using a prelaunch assessment tool is of vitalimportance--each year, there are heavy economic losses attributableto the failure of businesses. For example, Dr. Stephen C.Perry's study of the relationship between business planning (or lackthereof) and the failure of businesses in the United States turned upthis factoid: Each year, 17,000 businesses fail, and the aggregatelosses accrue to $40 billion.1 This is a staggering sum. By acting as a silent advisor at the very beginning of the thought process, theInnovator's Scorecard helps would-be entrepreneurs reasonthrough the facts that are known or that can be surmised up front.The entrepreneur can then predict the success or failure of his orher venture long before any serious money, savings, or resourcesare committed or spent. <em>Will it Fly?</em> is likely to be the best investmentany entrepreneur ever made.</p></p><h2>Philosophy of the Arts: An Introduction to Aesthetics</h2><p><p><em>Philosophy of the Arts</em> presents a comprehensive and accessible introduction to those coming to aesthetics and the philosophy of art for the first time.&nbsp;The third edition is greatly enhanced&nbsp;by new sections on art and beauty, modern art, Aristotle and katharsis, and Hegel.&nbsp;Each chapter has&nbsp;been thoroughly revised with fresh material and extended discussions.

As a result, early medieval history is much more fragmented, and there have been few convincing syntheses of socio-economic change in the post-Roman world since the 1930s. In recent decades, the rise of early medieval archaeology has also transformed our source-base, but this has not been adequately integrated into analyses of documentary history in almost any country. <br><br>In <em>Framing the Early Middle Ages </em>Chris Wickham aims at integrating documentary and archaeological evidence together, and also, above all, at creating a comparative history of the period 400-800, by means of systematic comparative analyses of each of the regions of the latest Roman and immediately post-Roman world, from Denmark to Egypt (only the Slav areas are left out). The book concentrates on classic socio-economic themes, state finance, the wealth and identity of the aristocracy, estate management, peasant society, rural settlement, cities, and exchange. These are only a partial picture of the period, but they are intended as a framing for other developments, without which those other developments cannot be properly understood. <br><br>Wickham argues that only a complex comparative analysis can act as the basis for a wider synthesis. Whilst earlier syntheses have taken the development of a single region as 'typical', with divergent developments presented as exceptions, this book takes all different developments as typical, and aims to construct a synthesis based on a better understanding of difference and the reasons for it. This is the most ambitious and original survey of the period ever written.<br></p><p><br><strong>Chris Wickham</strong> received his DPhil from Oxford in 1975.

China&#39;s War of Resistance began in 1937 with the Japanese invasion and ended in 1945 after eight long years. Diana Lary, one of the foremost historians of the period, tells the tragic history of China&#39;s war and its consequences from the perspective of those who went through it. Using archival evidence only recently made available, interviews with survivors, and extracts from literature, she creates a vivid and highly disturbing picture of the havoc created by the war, the destruction of towns and villages, the displacement of peoples, and the accompanying economic and social disintegration. Her focus is on families torn apart, men, women, and children left homeless and struck down by disease and famine. It is also a story of courage and survival. By 1945, the fabric of China&#39;s society had been utterly transformed, and entirely new social categories had emerged. As the author suggests in a new interpretation of modern Chinese history, far from stemming the spread of communism from the USSR, which was the Japanese pretext for invasion, the horrors of the war, and the damage it created, nurtured the Chinese Communist Party and helped it to win power in 1949.</p><p>Diana Lary, one of the foremost historians of the period, tells the tragic history of China&#39;s War of Resistance and its consequences from the perspective of those who went through it.

Problematic from the very beginning, even its contemporaries saw the treaty as a mediocre compromise, creating a precarious order in Europe and abroad and destined to fall short of ensuring lasting peace. At the time, observers read the treaty through competing lenses: a desire for peace after five years of disastrous war, demands for vengeance against Germany, the uncertain future of colonialism, and, most alarmingly, the emerging threat of Bolshevism. A century after its signing, we can look back at how those developments evolved through the twentieth century, evaluating the treaty and its consequences with unprecedented depth of perspective.<br><br>The author of several award-winning books, Michael S. Neiberg provides a lucid and authoritative account of the Treaty of Versailles, explaining the enormous challenges facing those who tried to put the world back together after the global destruction of the World War I. Rather than assessing winners and losers, this compelling book analyzes the many subtle factors that influenced the treaty and the dominant, at times ambiguous role of the "Big Four" leaders: Woodrow Wilson of the United States, David Lloyd George of Great Britain, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando of Italy, and Georges Cl�menceau of France.<br><br>The Treaty of Versailles was not solely responsible for the catastrophic war that crippled Europe and the world just two decades later, but it played a critical role. As Neiberg reminds us, to understand decolonization, World War II, the Cold War, and even the complex world we inhabit today, there is no better place to begin than with World War I and the treaty that tried, and perhaps failed, to end it.<br><br><strong>ABOUT THE SERIES: </strong>The <em>Very Short Introductions</em> series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

This book is one of those rare treats that put into words what expert nurses come to know and experience over time in their best practice.

Strengths-based nursing is refreshingly liberating; it is focused on what is needed to sustain health and life itself. It is the necessary shift needed to redirect treatment and caring models from disease to health. It brings to the foreground strengths and positive options, and what is right, for our own daily living and health, versus what is wrong. This revolutionary work offers a breath of life into dominant medically oriented care models and liberates the human spirit of both nurses and those we serve.

I hope that this book will become the <i>Notes On Nursing</i> of the 21st century. It has the power to transform nursing practice and with it, to transform the delivery of health care and the health care system.

Dr. Gottlieb has developed an approach to nursing that I believe holds a key in revolutionizing not only the discipline of nursing, but all of health care. She draws on the best traditions of nursing - the strengths of nursing itself that have endured for ages. As Dr. Gottlieb explains, nursing's deepest values have been derailed with the emergence of the "technocratic era." In this era, a deficit model prevails that emphasizes problems. Dr. Gottlieb proposes that we can and must turn our focus on strengths, and bring together four elements of strengths-based nursing: person-centered care, health promotion, collaborative partnerships and empowerment. I highly recommend this book for all nurses, and encourage all nursing faculty everywhere to embrace this book as a basic text. </p><p><b>Peggy L. Chinn</b>, RN, PhD, FAAN<br> Professor Emerita <br> University of Connecticut </p> <p>In the hallowed tradition of Florence Nightingale, who argued that nursing's mandate was 'to put the patient in the best condition for nature to act upon him', Gottlieb has captured the best within the philosophical core of nursing theorizing and modernized it for today's nurse. In <i>Strengths-Based Nursing</i>, she deconstructs the fine details of everyday nursing thinking and action, guiding the development of a thoroughly moral, optimistic and practical clinical wisdom within the practitioner across the spectrum of health and illness. Capturing our attention with examples and exemplars, she takes us on an engaging and highly reflexive journey through how the health care world looks from a genuinely nursing angle of vision. In an era of renewed interest in authentic patient engagement, Gottlieb's text will be an outstanding toolkit with which to support and develop the profession. </p> <p><b>Sally Thorne</b>, RN, PHD, FAAN, FCAHS <br> Professor<br> University of British Columbia</p> <p>Laurie Gottlieb is an exemplary scholar who has produced a unique volume, which blends the accumulated wisdom of several decades' immersion in nursing with expert clinical testimony into a new synthesis known as the strengths based model of nursing.

It is also the first practical guide for nurses on how to incorporate the knowledge, skills, and tools of SBC into everyday practice. The text builds on and further develops concepts in a model developed by the prestigious McGill University Nursing Program. SBC signifies a paradigm shift in nursing care from a model based on problems, deficits, and pathology to an approach to care that focuses on individual, family, and community strengths as a cornerstone of effective nursing care. The testimony of 46 nurses demonstrates how SBC can be effectively used in multiple settings across the lifespan. </p> <p>The book develops the theoretical foundations underlying SBC, promotes the acquisition of fundamental skills needed for SBC practice, and offers specific strategies, techniques, and tools for identifying strengths and harnessing them to facilitate healing and health. According to the SBC model, the text describes how one becomes a nurse through retraining the senses, developing observation skills, and reforming interpersonal and communication skills for clinical judgment and decision-making.

In fact, we have often eaten them into extinction, whether it is the megafauna of the Paleolithic world or the passenger pigeon of the last century. In Lost Feast, food expert Lenore Newman sets out to look at the history of the foods we have loved to death and what that means for the culinary paths we choose for the future. Whether it&#x2019;s chasing down the luscious butter of local Icelandic cattle or looking at the impacts of modern industrialized agriculture on the range of food varieties we can put in our shopping carts, Newman&#x2019;s bright, intelligent gaze finds insight and humor at every turn. </p> <p>Bracketing the chapters that look at the history of our relationship to specific foods, Lenore enlists her ecologist friend and fellow cook, Dan, in a series of &#x201c;extinction dinners&#x201d; designed to recreate meals of the past or to illustrate how we might be eating in the future. Part culinary romp, part environmental wake-up call, Lost Feast makes a critical contribution to our understanding of food security today. You will never look at what&#x2019;s on your plate in quite the same way again.</p></p><p><b>Lenore Newman</b> is the Canada Research Chair in Food Security and Environment at the University of the Fraser Valley. She is the author of the acclaimed Speaking in Cod Tongues: A Canadian Culinary Journey. She divides her time between Vancouver and Roberts Creek, British Columbia.<p>To understand these culinary extinction threats, imagine a feast. It can be any feast: a Las Vegas buffet, a family holiday dinner, a South Pacific pit BBQ, or an Indonesian rijsttafel, the classic meal of many small dishes, served for special occasions.&nbsp; Imagine a meal with many dishes and more food than can possibly be eaten at once. There are two things in that feast, aside from a great deal of hidden labour. There are dozens, if not hundreds, of species of plants and animals, a sort of culinary menagerie. There is also a huge body of culinary knowledge, the accumulated knowledge of growing, harvesting, processing and preparing foods handed down and improved upon over generations. A feast is a bit like a book, but a tasty book we read through eating. Now imagine that the dishes start to disappear one by one. The raspberries for the waffles, the sage on the Thanksgiving turkey, the poi or the pisang goreng. Gone. Slowly the table becomes less interesting, less captivating, and as each species disappears, the accompanying cultural knowledge vanishes with it.</p><br> <p>This is the paradox of the lost feast. Even as we enjoy a time in which food is cheaper, more diverse and more available than ever before, the spectre of extinction threatens to radically challenge how we eat. In fact, it is already happening.</p></p><h2>Outdated Advertising: Sexist, Racist, Creepy, and Just Plain Tasteless Ads from a Pre-PC Era</h2><p><b>This outrageous collection of inappropriate ads will have you turning the pages and shaking your head in disbelief.</b><br><i>Outdated Advertising: Memories from a Less-than-PC Era</i> takes a look at print advertising from the mid-1850s through the 1980s with an eye toward ads that were notorious for their sexist, racist, politically-incorrect, or other wildly inappropriate content&#x2014;or for just plain bad taste.

Sarah Booth Delaney follows a winding trail of murder and deception into a world where ghosts make fashion statements&#x2014;and where one person&#x2019;s miracle is another person&#x2019;s mayhem.<br><br>The leaves of the calendar may be shedding faster than the sycamores on her family&#x2019;s decaying Mississippi plantation, but thirty-something southern belle Sarah Booth Delaney isn&#x2019;t ready to sing the blues. Not when she&#x2019;s got a thriving detective agency and the outspoken, outrageously attired ghost of her great-great-grandmother&#x2019;s nanny to keep her on her toes. But the matchmaking phantom may have the last word on motherhood when Sarah Booth takes on the controversial case of an accused baby killer.<br><br>Although Doreen Mallory&#x2019;s been arrested for feeding sleeping pills to her ten-week-old daughter, no one could accuse her of lacking faith. A healer who, tragically, couldn&#x2019;t save her own baby girl, born with multiple birth defects, Doreen has her own crosses to bear. While the local law seems convinced of Doreen&#x2019;s guilt, Sarah Booth isn&#x2019;t so sure. But why is Doreen reluctant to talk about the men in her life? Like the televangelist who stands to lose a lot more than his flock. Or the married politician with family ties to the Mob. Either of them could be little Rebekah&#x2019;s father; either of them could also be her killer.<br><br>With Halloween approaching and her own personal life up for grabs, Sarah Booth could use a little faith healing herself.

In the rustle of the cotton leaves, in the clear light of autumn, and the grape smell of blooming kudzu, the past lurks like a siren, promising the pleasure of memory and delivering the pain of regret.<br><br>Sitting on the front porch at Dahlia House, sipping a third cup of coffee, I watch the sycamore leaves drift into the driveway. Dahlia House needs a coat of paint. I need so much more than that.<br><br>The leaves of the calendar seem to be shedding faster than the sycamores, and I'm caught in limbo. I went to bed last night thinking about Sheriff Coleman Peters and his pregnant wife, and I awoke this morning remembering the feel of Scott Hampton beside me. I sat up in bed, knowing that I let Scott walk away without a single word that might have encouraged him to stay. One word. Please. It might have been enough.<br><br>That I couldn't ask him to stay while I sorted through the secrets of my heart doesn't make it any easier to wake up alone, remembering a man's touch. October arouses terrible longings. The Delaney womb is sending a series of demanding and not-so-subtle messages.<br><br>"If I didn't know better, I'd say you were havin' a case of the low-down and dirties." The familiar voice came from behind me. "The blues, unless you're singin' 'em, are a total waste of time, Sarah Booth Delaney."<br><br>I sniffed the air, catching the tantalizing scent of a cigarette. I hadn't smoked in three years, but the craving was on me in a flash. Glancing over my shoulder, I was amazed to see Jitty, a circa 1850's ghost, reclining in a rocking chair, with one leg draped over the arm. A lazy drift of smoke curled from a cigarette holder in her right hand.<br><br>"What are you doing?" I was astounded at the cigarette and her outfit. Her dress was a short, tight tube of glittery mauve material layered with black fringe. A matching band of material circled her head, allowing some artfully arranged curls to escape. Clunky shoes with high heels were strapped across her feet, leading up to stockings with a seam.<br><br>"Close your mouth," she advised, clamping the cigarette holder between her teeth. "I ain't smokin', I'm just stylin'."<br><br>"What would it hurt if you were? You're a ghost," I pointed out. "You can smoke without any ill effects."<br><br>"Smoke won't kill you nearly as quickly as regrets," Jitty said matter-of-factly.<br><br>"What are you doing in that getup?" I asked, indicating her dress. "It's nine o'clock in the morning." Jitty, as the resident haint of Dahlia House, punched no mortal time clocks. She was on the job twenty-four/seven. "Not even ghosts have costume balls in the morning, and you're about a week early for Halloween."<br><br>"You are in a mood," she said. "Scott Hampton wasn't the man for you, Sarah Booth. He'da made one fine sperm donor, but he wasn't built for the long haul. Quit kickin' yourself and focus on the positive."<br><br>"Like what?" I asked, and then instantly regretted it. Asking Jitty such a question was a bit like inviting a vampire into your house.<br><br>"Do you know when women got the right to vote?" she asked.<br><br>I sighed. "No, I don't. And I don't care. My own personal history is troublesome enough without taking on the world. I know everything there is to know about me, and I still can't fix my life. Knowing all that history won't help anyone. It just makes a person run around in strange outfits."<br><br>"It was 1920. Up until your mother's generation, women couldn't even establish credit in their own name. Back then, a woman didn't have a man, she didn't stand a chance of survivin'. Leastways nowadays you can be an old maid and still keep your property."<br><br>I looked at my black coffee and wished for a good dollop of Jameson in it. To that end I got up and went inside. Instead of going to the parlor where the bar was, at the last minute I turned left and headed for my new office. I'd been up since five arranging the two new desks, two new chairs, filing cabinets, telephones, fax machine, and other office paraphernalia. I'd had a busy and productive morning. Until I'd started thinking about Scott.<br><br>Jitty followed me, lecturing as she went, but I wasn't about to encourage her by answering. The past haunted both of us, and I saw no good end in indulging in it.<br><br>The room I'd selected as the official digs for Delaney Detective Agency was a master bedroom suite in the east wing of the house. It was perfect because it had its own entrance and a small sitting room that would serve perfectly for a receptionist, should that day ever arrive when we could afford one. I'd kept the entire project a secret from Tinkie, but I was expecting her at any minute so I could spring the surprise. Her desk even had a nameplate. And the frosted glass exterior door said Delaney Detective Agency. The next lines were Delaney and Richmond, Private Investigators.<br><br>"What do you think, Jitty?" I couldn't resist asking her, though she had grave doubts about my ability to decorate.<br><br>"It would look a lot better if there were a few clients sitting around in it."<br><br>"I'll get another case," I said, wondering if that was true. Six weeks is a long time for a detective to lay fallow. "Maybe we should celebrate the new office with a Bloody Mary?"<br><br>"There was a time when a woman couldn't walk in a bar and order a drink." Jitty's chocolate eyes sparkled.<br><br>The part about bars got my attention fast. "When did that change?"<br><br>"Your mother's generation. At least, that's when it became publicly acceptable for women to drink in bars. 'Course, women have always drunk liquor, and I'm not talkin' about a dainty glass of sherry. The rule was that decent women didn't drink." She raised perfectly shaped eyebrows. "I guess a gal like you would've ended up in the hoosegow or scrubbin' floors in some mission."<br><br>Jitty's point was well taken. I was benefiting from many generations of work on the part of courageous women who demanded change in the way their gender was viewed and treated. I sat down at my desk and put my feet up. "Okay, so I've come a long way, baby. I concede that point. How about an exhibit of the Charleston?"<br><br>"Sit up straight and quit actin' like some kind of tart," Jitty said. "Our work's not finished. Not by a long shot. It ain't time to put your feet up yet."<br><br>My glow of feminism paled. Jitty had an agenda; I was going to suffer. This was one equation that never failed to prove true. "I need a new case, Jitty, not a social conscience."<br><br>"You need both of them. But even that won't fulfill your female destiny. What you need is a man. You're the generation that can have it all, remember?"<br><br>Leave it to Jitty to state the obvious when my friends weren't doing it.<br><br>"Thanks. I'll check the newspaper and see if they have any good sales going on men." But she had backed herself into a corner, and I was going to enjoy watching her try to squirm out of it. "Think about it, though, Jitty. If I'm going to be the spearhead for women's rights in Sunflower County, I think it would look a lot better if I were independent. You know, one of the I-don't-need-a-man-for-nothin' women. If I had a husband, it would make me look like a hypocrite, don't you think?"<br><br>"Ticktock, Sarah Booth. You gonna rationalize yourself right into barrenness."<br><br>"Go away and leave me alone." Jitty knew my hot buttons way too well.<br><br>"I'll be back," she said, and though it was spoken in a soft drawl, it had the definite ring of the Terminator. And then she was gone.<br><br>My attention was drawn to the green Caddy coming down the driveway, and I felt a little tingle of happiness to see my partner arriving.<br><br>The new office had windows facing the front and the side, so I'd have a good view of anyone driving up. This is a great advantage for an investigator, who should always present the illusion of never being caught by surprise. I smiled at the thought of Jitty and her new obsession. Some would say I was discussing illusions with a delusion.<br><br>I heard Tinkie's rap at the front door. "Come in," I hollered. "I'm in the Peacock Suite." So called because of the huge vase of peacock feathers that stood in a corner of the room. I'd thought about removing them but decided Tinkie and I needed all the luck we could muster.<br><br>"What in the world are you doing on this side of the house? I was thinking when you called so early that you were probably making a batch of French toast. I just had my mouth set on--" She made it to the doorway and stopped.<br><br>Her gaze moved around the room, taking in every detail. At last it stopped at her desk and the nameplate. "Sarah Booth," she squealed in her best sorority sound of incommunicable happiness. She snatched up the nameplate. "It's wonderful!"<br><br>I was grinning big when Tinkie lowered Chablis to the floor and gave me a hug, her head tucked under my chin. The little Yorkie, delighted to be free, rushed toward the kitchen and my own dog, Sweetie Pie. The two were as unlikely a pair as Tinkie and I, but they were also great friends.<br><br>"I thought we needed a real office," I said.<br><br>"My name is on the door." There were tears in her eyes.<br><br>"You're half the agency."<br><br>"You're too much, Sarah Booth."<br><br>"And you're hungry. Let's go make some breakfast."<br><br>"French toast?"<br><br>"If that's what you'd like."<br><br>We were halfway to the kitchen when the red telephones began to ring. I'd stolen the red phone idea from Kinky Friedman, and I got a real thrill when they rang.<br><br>We rushed back to the office. I started to pick one up, but then I nodded at Tinkie.<br><br>"Delaney Detective Agency," she said, her eyes shining. "This is Tinkie Richmond speaking."<br><br>There was a long pause. "Yes, I see. Let me confer with my associate, and we'll call you right back." She picked up a pen and made a note of a phone number on a pad. When she hung up the phone her eyes were wide. "That was a nun from New Orleans. She wants to hire us to help a woman in Sunflower County Jail."<br><br>We needed a case. Or at least I did. Tinkie had a rich husband and a rich daddy. Financial needs weren't part of her landscape.<br><br>"A nun?" Sunflower County had a Catholic church, St. Lucy's. There was a priest, but the head count for nuns was zilch. "Did she say who the woman was or what she'd done?"<br><br>Tinkie nodded. "Her name is Doreen Mallory. She's charged with murdering her infant girl in New Orleans."<br>2<br>The ditches were filled with the nodding heads of black-eyed Susans. Tinkie drove the big Caddy and talked excitedly about the upcoming interview with Doreen Mallory. I looked out the window and wondered what I would say to Coleman. I hadn't seen him since the August night that Spider and Ray-Ban had been arrested for the murder of Ivory Keys. That was the night his wife had caught us in an embrace and announced her pregnancy.<br><br>All in all, it was a low point of my life.<br><br>"I heard Connie's having a tough time with the pregnancy," Tinkie said.<br><br>"I'm sorry to hear that." But I wasn't. Connie had deliberately gotten pregnant because she knew she was losing her husband. I wished her morning, midday, afternoon, evening, and night sickness.<br><br>"I heard Coleman was taking her to Jackson for psychiatric help." Tinkie kept her eyes on the road.<br><br>"Probably a good thing." I felt a pang, but I wasn't certain if it was guilt or hope or revenge. I didn't want to examine it further.<br><br>"Did you ever talk to Coleman?" she asked point-blank.<br><br>I looked at her. "No. What was there to say? I'm ashamed of myself. And I'm embarrassed for him. He's married and his wife is having his baby. That's all there is to it."<br><br>Tinkie slowed the car. "I never thought you were dumb, Sarah Booth, but you're sure acting like blonde roots have snarled up your brain. You and Coleman have to talk about this and settle it once and for all. You can't leave things up in the air."<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>"You're going to have to see him in just a few minutes. What are you going to do, pretend that you don't feel something for him?"<br><br>"That was my plan."<br><br>She rolled her eyes. "I never took you for a coward."<br><br>That stung, and my first reaction was an urge to lash out, but I didn't. Tinkie was never cruel. And this time she was right. Avoiding Coleman had been the easiest path. Now I was going to have to face him.<br><br>"I know I need to talk to him. I honestly don't know what to say. He's trapped. Nothing I say can change that. He can't abandon Connie now. The best thing we can do is avoid each other."<br><br>Tinkie sighed. "Do you ever hear anything from Bridge?"<br><br>Bridge Ladnier was a wealthy entrepreneur Tinkie had tried to set me up with. I'd mistakenly pegged him as a murderer in my last case. "He sent me my mother's earring that I dropped in his house. I thought he and Cece had sort of hit it off."<br><br>"He's a nice man," she said, picking up speed again. "He's developed a friendship with Cece. I know he was smitten by you, Sarah Booth."<br><br>Had Bridge come into my life at any other time, I might have fallen for him. "I made a mess of everything."<br><br>Tinkie pulled into a parking space at the courthouse square. "Not everything. You solved the case, freed Scott Hampton, salvaged Ivory's dream, and made Ida Mae a happy woman. That's not bad."<br><br>"With your help, Tinkie. But thanks, you always say the right thing." I reached over to touch her hand but she was already a blur of motion exiting her car.<br><br>"I'm going to the ladies' room," she said, dashing up the courthouse steps. It was only when she'd disappeared inside that I realized why she was in such a hurry. Coleman Peters was getting out of the car beside me. His gaze was locked on mine.<br><br>I slowly got out of the Caddy and stood with one hand on the door. He walked over, and for a moment I thought he was going to pull me into his arms. But he didn't. We stood staring at each other, and I realized that we didn't need to say much. I read everything on his face: futility, exhaustion, lost hope, a grim determination to do the right thing.</p><h2>Architectures of Possibility: After Innovative Writing</h2><p><p><strong>Who says you can't teach creativity?</strong></p><p>Ideal for individual or classroom use, ARCHITECTURES OF POSSIBILITY theorizes and questions the often unconscious assumptions behind such traditional writing gestures as temporality, scene, and characterization; offers various suggestions for generating writing that resists, rethinks, and/or expands the very notion of narrativity; visits a number of important concerns/trends/obsessions in current writing (both on the page and off); discusses marketplace (ir)realities; hones critical reading and manuscript editing capabilities; and strengthens problem-solving muscles from brainstorming to literary activism.</p><p>Exercises and supplemental reading lists challenge authors to push their work into self-aware and surprising territory.

She makes her home in the Pacific Northwest with her husband, Frank.<i>Prologue</i><br><br>The hall clock struck midnight. It was a death knell. The beautiful, old-fashioned, terrifyingly heavy dress that did not fit her properly because it had been made for another woman, hampered her frantic flight down the corridor. The fine wool fabric tangled itself around her legs, threatening to trip her with every desparate step. She pulled the skirts higher, higher, almost to her knees, and risked a glance back over her shoulder.<br><br>He was closing on her, running her down the way a hound, maddened with blood lust, runs a deer to earth. His once demonically handsome face, the face that had lured an innocent, trusting woman first into marriage and then to her doom, was now a mask of fear and murderous, burning rage. With wild eyes that bulged from his head and hair that stood on end, he stalked her. The knife in his hand would soon be at her throat.<br><br>"<i>Demon bitch</i>." His shout of rage echoed down the upstairs hall. The light of a flickering taper glinted on the evil-looking blade he clutched. "You are dead. Why cannot you leave me in peace? I swear I will send you back to hell where you belng. And this time I will make certain the deed is done right. Hear me, you accursed specter. <i>This time I will make certain</i>." She wanted to scream and could not. All she could do was run for her life.<br><br>"I will watch your blood flow through my fingers until you are drained," he cried out behind her, much closer. "This time you will stay dead, demon bitch. You have caused me trouble enough."<br><br>She was at the top of the stairs now, gasping for breath. Fear clawed at her insides. Holding the thick skirts even higher, she started down the staircase, one hand on the banister to keep herself from falling. It would be a bitter irony to die of a broken neck rather than a slashed throat.<br><br>He was so close, so very close. She knew there was every chance she would not make it back to safety. This time she had gone too far, taken one risk too many. She had played the part of a ghost and now she was very likely to become one. He would be on top of her before she reached the bottom step.<br><br>She had finally gotten the proof she had sought. In his rage he had confessed. If she lived, she would have justice for her poor mother. But it was fast becoming apparent that her quest would cost her her life.<br><br>Soon she would feel his hands on her, grabbing at her in a dreadful parody of the sexual embrace he had threatened her with when she was younger. Then she would feel the knife.<br><br>The knife.<br><br>Dear God, the knife.<br><br>She was halfway down the stairs when her pursuer&#x2019;s hideous scream rent the shadows.<br><br>She looked back in horror and realized that for the rest of her life, midnight would never be quite the same again. For her, midnight would mean nightmare.<br><i>ONE</i><br>Victoria Claire Huntington knew when she was being stalked. She had not reached the advanced age of twenty-four without learning to recognize the sophisticated fortune hunters of the ton. Heiresses were, after all, fair game.<br><br>The fact that she was still single and mistress of her own sizable inheritance was proof of her skill at evading the slick, deceitful opportunists who thrived in her world. Victoria had determined long ago never to fall victim to their attractive, superficial charms.<br><br>But Lucas Mallory Colebrook, the new Earl of Stonevale, was different. He might very well be an opportunist, but there was definitely nothing slick or superficial about him. Amid the brightly plumed birds of the ton, this man was a hawk.<br><br>Victoria was beginning to wonder if the very qualities that should have warned her off, the underlying strength and the implacable will she sensed in Stonevale, were exactly what had drawn her to him. There was no denying she had been fascinated by the man since they had been introduced less than an hour ago. The attraction she felt was deeply disturbing. In fact, it was quite dangerous.<br><br>"I believe I have won again, my lord."Victoria lowered her elegantly gloved hand and fanned her cards out across the green baize table. She smiled her most dazzling smile at her opponent.<br><br>"Congratulations, Miss Huntington. Your luck is certainly running strong this evening."Stonevale, whose gray eyes made Victoria think of ghosts hovering in the dead of night, did not look in the least dismayed at his loss. He appeared, in fact, quietly satisfied, as if a carefully devised plan had just come to fruition. There was a sense of cool anticipation about him.<br><br>"Yes, my luck has been amazingly strong tonight, has it not?"Victoria murmured. "One might almost suspect it had some assistance."<br><br>"I refuse to contemplate such a possibility. I cannot allow you to impugn your own honor, Miss Huntington."<br><br>"Very gallant of you, my lord. But it was not <i>my</i> honor which concerned me. I assure you I am well aware that I was not cheating."Victoria held her breath knowing she had stepped out onto very thin ice with that remark. She had practically accused the earl of playing with marked cards in order to ensure her win.<br><br>Stonevale&#x2019;s eyes met and held hers across the table. His expression was unnervingly calm. Frighteningly calm, Victoria thought with a small shiver. There should have been some flicker of emotion in that cool, gray gaze. But she could read nothing in his face except a certain watchfulness.<br><br>"Would you care to clarify that remark, Miss Huntington?"<br><br>Victoria quickly decided to step back onto more solid ground. "Pray, pay me no heed, my lord. It is simply that I am as astounded as you should be at my luck with cards this evening. I am only an indifferent player at best. You, on the other hand, have a reputation as a skilled gamester, or so I have been told."<br><br>"You flatter me, Miss Huntington."<br><br>"I don&#x2019;t believe so," Victoria said. "I have heard tales of the ability you display at the tables of White&#x2019;s and Brook&#x2019;s as well as at certain other clubs here in town that are of a, shall we say, less reputable nature."<br><br>"Greatly embroidered tales, I imagine. But you make me curious. As we have only just met, where did you hear such stories?"<br><br>She could hardly admit she had asked her friend Annabella Lyndwood about him the moment he entered the ballroom two hours before. "I am certain you are aware of how such rumors fly, my lord."<br><br>"Indeed. But a woman of your obvious intelligence should know better than to listen to gossip." With a smooth, effortless motion Stonevale gathered up the cards into a neat stack. He rested his graceful, long-fingered hand on top of the deck and smiled coolly at Victoria. "Now, Miss Huntington, have you given any thought to collecting your winnings?"<br><br>Victoria watched him warily, unable to repress the excitement that was bubbling within her. If she had any sense, she would end this here and now, she told herself. But tonight it was difficult to think with the sort of cold, clear logic she usually employed in such circumstances. She had never met anyone quite like Stonevale.<br><br>The hum of conversation and laughter in Lady Atherton&#x2019;s card room receded, and the music from the ballroom seemed faint and distant now. The Athertons&#x2019; huge London house was filled with well-dressed members of the ton as well as countless servants, but Victoria suddenly felt as if she were completely alone with the earl.<br><br>"My winnings," Victoria repeated slowly, trying to school her thoughts. "Yes, I shall have to do something about them, won&#x2019;t I?"<br><br>"I believe the wager was for a favor, was it not? As the winner, you are entitled to request one of me. I am at your service."<br><br>"As it happens, sir, I do not need any favors from you at the moment."<br><br>"Are you quite certain of that?"<br><br>She was startled by the knowing expression in the earl&#x2019;s eyes. This was a man who always knew more than he ought. "Quite."<br><br>"I fear I must contradict you, Miss Huntington. I believe you do need a favor of me. I am given to understand that you will require an escort later this evening when you and Miss Lyndwood have your little adventure at the fair."<br><br>Victoria went very still. "What do you know of that?"<br><br>Stonevale gently riffled the cards with one long finger "Lyndwood and I are friends. Belong to the same clubs. Play cards together occasionally. You know how it is."<br><br>"Lord Lyndwood? Annabella&#x2019;s brother? You&#x2019;ve been talking to him?"<br><br>"Yes."<br><br>Victoria was incensed. "He promised to be our escort this evening and he gave us his words he would keep quiet on the matter. How dare he discuss this business with our cronies? This is too much by half. And men have the nerve to accuse women of gossiping. What an outrage."<br><br>"You must not be so hard on the man, Miss Huntington."<br><br>"What did Lyndwood do? Make a general announcement at one of his clubs that he would be taking his sister and her friend to the fair?"<br><br>"It was not a general announcement, I assure you. He was most discreet. After all, his sister is involved, is she not? If you must know the truth, I believe Lyndwood confided in me because he was feeling the strain of the situation."<br><br>"Strain? What strain? There is absolutely nothing about any of this that should make him anxious. He is simply going to escort Annabella and me to the park where the fair is being held. What could be simpler?" she snapped.<br><br>"As I understand it, you and his sister applied a certain degree of pressure on Lyndwood to get him to agree to your plans. The poor boy is still green enough to be manipulated by such feminine tactics. Fortunately, he is also wise enough to regret his weakness and smart enough to seek assistance."<br><br>"Poor boy, indeed. What nonsense. You make it sound as though Annabella and I coerced Bertie into this."<br><br>"Didn&#x2019;t you?" Stonevale shot back.<br><br>"Of course not. We merely impressed upon him that we have every intention of going to the fair tonight and he insisted on accompanying us. Very gallant of him. Or so we thought."<br><br>"You left him little choice as a gentleman. He could hardly agree to let you go on your own and you knew it. It was blackmail. Furthermore, I suspect it was largely your idea, Miss Huntington."<br><br>"<i>Blackmail</i>." Victoria was now furious. "I resent that accusation, my lord."<br><br>"Why? It is little more than the truth. Do you think Lyndwood would have willingly consented to escort you and his sister to such a disreputable event unless you threatened to go on your own? Miss Lyndwood&#x2019;s mama would have a fit of the vapors if she got word of this little escapade tonight, and so, I imagine, would your aunt."<br><br>"I assure you, Aunt Cleo is far too sturdy to indulge in a fit of the vapors," Victoria declared loyally. But she knew Stonevale was perfectly correct about Annabella&#x2019;s mama. Lady Lyndwood would indeed have hysterics if she discovered her daughter&#x2019;s plans for this evening. Proper young ladies of the ton did not go to the fairgrounds at night.</p><h2>Penalty Shot (Matt Christopher Sports Classics)</h2><p>After a hiatus from the ice to get his grades back up to eligibility level, Jeff Connors returns to get the cold shoulder treatment from his teammates. During Jeff&#39;s absence, a threatening note was discovered in his best friend&#39;s locker--written in Jeff&#39;s hand. His protests of innocence fall on deaf ears, so Jeff is on his own to discover who&#39;s behind the sabotage.</p><p>Matt Christopher is the best selling name behind more than 100 sports-themed books for young readers.After a season away from hockey because of slipping grades, Jeff Connors is in trouble again and anxious to keep his place on the team. A tutor helps Jeff shore up his worst grade, in English; under her guidance he begins to see what he's been doing wrong, and comes up with a decent composition that he hopes will redeem him in the eyes of the team and his coach. He and his best friend, Kevin, resolve to work hard to help the team win the title, and everything looks rosy. Then Kevin finds a nasty note in his locker that looks as if it were written by Jeff, and Jeff gets his English paper back with a failing grade--but it's not the paper he handed in. It's a puzzle, all right, one that befuddles Jeff even though readers who aren't as slow on the uptake as he is will have most of the details figured out. These one-dimensional jocks employ some fairly leaden dialogue on the way to the inevitable happy ending, but not even all those exclamation points can give the book a semblance of excitement.

Events quickly take a sinister turn when Anthony finds a mysterious old chest that turns out to be a doorway into a parallel world in which a mad group of beings are plotting the destruction of Earth. The key to their success is a magical object, the Logos cube. Unfortunately for the Autarchs, a former member of their society has realized their evil ways and hidden the cube. Anthony, Miss Eells, and Emerson experience a series of harrowing adventures as they explore the strange world of the Autarchs and search for the object so that they can save the Earth. The atmosphere throughout this adventuresome chiller is appropriately scary and the villains are certainly evil personified, but there are several loose ends. Readers never know why the Autarchs have so much interest in the Earth or why they want to destroy it. Their world is certainly a terrifying place, but its origins and purposes are never made clear. This story will attract Bellairs's fans, but it is not likely to win many new ones. --Bruce Anne Shook, Mendenhall Middle School, Greensboro, NC<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Bacchae of Euripides: A Communion Rite</h2><p><p><strong>A wholly fresh interpretation of the timeless play by a Nobel Prize-winning author.</strong></p> Wole Soyinka has translated&#x2015;in both language and spirit&#x2015;a great classic of ancient Greek theater. He does so with a poet's ear for the cadences and rhythms of chorus and solo verse as well as a commanding dramatic use of the central social and religious myth. In his hands The Bacchae becomes a communal feast, a tumultuous celebration of life, and a robust ritual of the human and social psyche. "The Bacchae is the rites of an extravagant banquet, a monstrous feast," Soyinka writes. "Man reaffirms his indebtedness to earth, dedicates himself to the demands of continuity, and invokes the energies of productivity. Reabsorbed within the communal psyche he provokes the resources of nature; in turn he is replenished for the cyclic rain in his fragile individual potency." The blending of two master playwrights&#x2015;Euripides and Soyinka&#x2015;makes for an unforgettable experience.</p><p>Wole Soyinka, one of Africa&#39;s foremost writers, won the Nobel Prize in 1986 and is the author of Death and the King&#39;s Horseman, among other works.</p><h2>Listening to God in Times of Choice: The Art of Discerning God&#39;s Will</h2><p>All Christians yearn to live at the center of God&#39;s will. But how to discern his will is an art that eludes many of us. And the advice we get often conflicts. Some tell us to look for a divine &#34;blueprint&#34;-the one perfect plan for our lives that we need to find. We are encouraged to search the Scriptures and hunt for signs, trying to uncover the map of our lives that God has drawn. Others have rejected the blueprint school of guidance for the &#34;wisdom school.&#34; With minds renewed by the teaching of Scripture, we are to develop the wisdom necessary to make wise choices. We are told not to expect that there is just one answer to God&#39;s will for every decision we face. Several may be possible. The difficulty with both approaches, writes Gordon Smith, is that they minimize the presence and voice of God in times of choice. Instead, he argues for a third way. He suggests that we develop discernment as a spiritual discipline. By stressing the personal aspects of growing in our relationship with God, we can understand his will, not just in times of crisis but throughout our daily lives. This book provides no magic formulas, no recipes for guaranteed success-just a lot of insight, gleaned from centuries of lived Christian experience, that will guide and encourage you in the art of discerning God&#39;s will.</p><p>Gordon T.

Today, books on &#x201c;design thinking&#x201d; are best sellers, and computer and Web-based tools have expanded the definition of who practices design. Looking at objects, letterforms, experiences, and even theatrical performances, award-winning author Jessica Helfand asserts that understanding design's purpose is more crucial than ever. Design is meaningful not because it is pretty but because it is an intrinsically humanist discipline, tethered to the very core of why we exist. For example, as designers collaborate with developing nations on everything from more affordable lawn mowers to cleaner drinking water, they must take into consideration the full range of a given community&#x2019;s complex social needs. Advancing a conversation that is unfolding around the globe, Helfand offers an eye-opening look at how designed things make us feel as well as how&#x2014;and why&#x2014;they motivate our behavior.</p><p>Design is an intrinsically humanist discipline, tethered to the very core of why we exist. It frames our conception of power, informs our belief about personal dignity, piques our curiosity about fiction and fantasy; highlights our yearning for romance and beauty; and engages our eternal appetite for narrative. Design matters because of the why, not the what: the sentiment, not the acquisition. Design matters because people matter, and the purpose of this book is to examine precisely this proposition: to consider the conscience-driven rules of human engagement within which design must operate. This is a book about design as it relates to human beings. Because that is what matters most of all.To embrace design is to spark novelty, improve livability, expand opportunity, streamline productivity, leverage capability, and massage readability: but perhaps most importantly it is to engage humanity. And we do this best by being human, ourselves.</p><h2>Retaining Walls: A Building Guide and Design Gallery (Schiffer Books)</h2><p>Whether it&#39;s a challenging hillside, an uneven backyard, or a shrubless plot in need of planters, this book will provide nformation to solve any landscaping dilemma while adding curb appeal and value to your property.

At a time when the moral universe was shifting and advances in scientific knowledge promised humans dominion over that which had been God's alone, Mary Shelley envisioned a story of human presumption and its misbegotten consequences. Two centuries later, that story is still constantly retold and reinterpreted, from Halloween cartoons to ominous allusions in the public debate, capturing and conveying meaning central to our consciousness today and our concerns for tomorrow. From Victorian musical theater to Boris Karloff with neck bolts, to invocations at the President's Council on Bioethics, the monster and his myth have inspired everyone from cultural critics to comic book addicts. This is a lively and eclectic cultural history, illuminated with dozens of pictures and illustrations, and told with skill and humor. Susan Tyler Hitchcock uses film, literature, history, science, and even punk music to help us understand the meaning of this monster made by man. 68 illustrations</p><p>Susan Tyler Hitchcock&#x2019;s last book was Mad Mary Lamb: Lunacy and Murder in Literary London. Married with two children, she lives near Charlottesville, Virginia.Literary historian Hitchcock (<i>Mad Mary Lamb: Lunacy and Murder in Literary London</i>) leads readers on a guided tour of <i>Frankenstein</i> appearances in this colorful and consistently entertaining narrative. The history begins, appropriately, with the monster's unlikely creation by Mary Shelley as a result of a ghost story challenge (also taken up by John William Polidori, whose tale of a vampyre would later inspire Bram Stoker). Hitchcock then lays bare the publishing world of the 19th century, a veritable Wild West of unauthorized stage adaptations, parodies and continuations in which <i>Frankenstein</i> thrived. James Whale's Karloff classic gets its due, as do the disturbing and innovative 1910 Edison Company production and the 1952 live television broadcast starring a drunk Lon Chaney Jr. Running throughout the book is the parallel story of the invocation of Frankenstein in the public discourse as a metaphor for subjects ranging from the Crimean war to genetically modified organisms. While some <i>Frankenstein</i> dilettantes might find the narrow focus of the book somewhat tedious, there are enough strange and delightful anecdotes to keep most readers engaged.

Like his teammates and rivals, he trained for countless hours, sacrificing his body and potential career for a chance at fleeting glory without fortune or fame. His only goal: to win Nationals and go down in Ultimate history as one of the greatest athletes no one has ever heard of.&nbsp;<br><br>With humor and raw honesty, Gessner explores what it means to devote one&#x2019;s life to something that many consider ridiculous. Today, Ultimate is played by millions, but in the 1980s, it was an obscure sport with a (mostly) undeserved stoner reputation. Its early heroes were as scrappy as the sport they loved, driven by fierce competition, intense rivalries, epic parties, and the noble ideals of the Spirit of the Game.&nbsp;<br> <i><br>Ultimate Glory</i>&nbsp;is a portrait of the artist as a young ruffian. Gessner shares the field and his seemingly insane obsession with a cast of closely knit, larger-than-life characters. As his sport grows up, so does he, and eventually he gives up chasing flying discs to pursue a career as a writer. But he never forgets his love for this misunderstood sport and the rare sense of purpose he attained as a member of its priesthood.</p><p><b>David Gessner</b>&nbsp;is the author of ten books, including the&nbsp;<i>New York Times&nbsp;</i>bestseller&nbsp;<i>All the Wild That Remains</i>.

Pioneered by respected researchers such as Jung, Maslow and Tart, it has nonetheless struggled to find recognition among mainstream scientists. Now that is starting to change. Dr. Michael Daniels teaches the subject as part of a broadly-based psychology curriculum, and this book brings together the fruits of his studies over recent years. It will be of special value to students, and its accessible style will appeal also to all who are interested in the spiritual dimension of human experience. The book includes a detailed 38-page glossary of terms and detailed indexes.</p></p><p><p>"This is a splendid book, ranging widely across the whole spectrum of Transpersonal Psychology.

She is a certified marriage and family counselor, a Texas Tech graduate and writer-in-residence at West Texas A&amp;M University. She lives with her husband in Amarillo, Texas.<em>Staten</em><br><br>Staten Kirkland lowered the brim of his felt Resisted as he turned into the wind. The hat was about to live up to its name. Hell was blowing down from the north, and he would have to ride hard to make it back to headquarters before the full fury of the storm broke. His new mount, a roan he'd bought last week, was green and spooked by the winter lightning. Staten had no time to put on the gloves in his back pocket. He had to ride.<br><br>When the mare bucked in protest, he twisted the reins around his hand and felt the cut of leather across his palm as he fought for control of both his horse and the memories threatening as low as the dark clouds above his head.<br><br>Icy rain had poured that night five years ago, only he hadn't been on his ranch; he'd been trapped in the hallway of the county hospital fifty miles away. His son had lain at one end, fighting for his life, and reporters had huddled just beyond the entrance at the other end, hollering for news.<br><br>All they'd cared about was that the kid's grandfather was a United States senator. No one had cared that Staten, the boy's father and only parent, held them back. All they'd wanted was a headline. All Staten had wanted was for his son to live.<br><br>But, he didn't get what he wanted.<br><br>Randall, only child of Staten Kirkland, only grandchild of Senator Samuel Kirkland, had died that night. The reporters had gotten their headline, complete with pictures of Staten storming through the double doors, swinging at every man who tried to stop him. He'd left two reporters and a clueless intern on the floor, but he hadn't slowed.<br><br>He'd run into the storm that night not caring about the rain. Not caring about his own life. Two years before he'd buried his wife, and now he would put his son in the ground beside her because of a car crash. He'd had to run from the ache so deep in his heart it would never heal.<br><br>Now, five years later, another storm was blowing through, but the ache inside him hadn't lessened. He rode toward headquarters on the half-wild horse. Rain mixed with tears he never let anyone see. He'd wanted to die that night. He had no one. His wife's illness had left both father and son bitter, lost. If she'd lived, maybe Randall would have been different. Calmer. Maybe if he'd had her love, the boy wouldn't have been so wild. He wouldn't have thought himself so invincible.<br><br>Only, taking a winding road at over a hundred miles per hour <em>had</em> killed him. The car his grandfather had given him for his sixteenth birthday a month earlier had missed the curve heading into Ransom Canyon and rolled over and over. The newspapers had quoted one first responder as saying, <em>"Thank God he 'd been alone. No one in that sports car would have survived."</em><br><br>Staten wished he'd been with his boy. He'd felt dead inside the day he buried Randall next to his wife, and he felt dead now as memories pounded.<br><br>He rode close to the canyon rim as the storm raged, almost wishing the jagged earth would claim him, too. But, he was fifth generation born to this land. There would be no more Kirklands after him, and he wouldn't go without a fight.<br><br>As he raced, he remembered the horror of seeing his son pulled out of the wreck, too beat up and bloody for even a father to recognize. Kirkland blood had poured over the red dirt of the canyon that night.<br><br>He rode feeling the pounding of his horse's hooves match the beat of his heart.<br><br>When Staten crossed under the Double K gate and let the horse gallop to the barn, he took a deep breath, knowing what he had to do.<br><br>Looking up, he saw Jake there at the barn door waiting for him. The rodeo had crippled the old man, but Jake Longbow was still the best hand on the ranch.<br><br>"Dry him off!" Staten yelled above the storm as he handed over the mare to Jake's care. "I have to go."<br><br>The old cowboy, his face like twisted rawhide, nodded once as if he knew what Staten would say. A thousand times over the years, Jake had moved into action before Staten issued the order. "I got this, Mr. Kirkland. You do what you got to do."<br><br>Darting across the back corral, Staten climbed into the huge Dodge 3500 with its Cummins diesel engine and four-wheel drive. The truck might guzzle gas and ride rough, but if he slid off the road tonight, it wouldn't roll.<br><br>Half an hour later he finally slowed as he turned into a farm twenty miles north of Crossroads, Texas. A sign, in need of painting and with a few bullet holes in it, read simply "Lavender Lane." Even in the rain the air here smelled of lavender. He'd made it to Quinn's place. One house, one farm, sat alone with nothing near enough to call a neighbor.<br><br>Quinn O'Grady's home always reminded him of a little girl's fancy dollhouse: brightly painted shutters and gingerbread trim everywhere. Folks sometimes commented on how the house was as fancy as the woman who owned it was plain, but Staten had never thought of her that way. She was shy, had kept to herself even in grade school, but she was her own woman. She'd built a living out of the worthless land her parents had left her.<br><br>He might have gone his whole life saying no more than hello to her, but Quinn O'Grady had been his wife's best friend. Even after he'd married Amalah, she'd still have her "girls' days" with Quinn.<br><br>They'd can peaches in the fall and take courses at the church on quilting and pottery. They'd take off to Dallas for an art show or to Canton for the world's biggest garage sale. He couldn't count the times his wife had climbed into Quinn's old green pickup and simply called out that they were going shopping as if that were all he needed to know. Half the time they didn't come back with anything but ice-cream-sundae smiles.<br><br>Quinn hadn't talked to him much in those early years, but she'd been a good friend to his wife, and that mattered. Near the end, she'd sat with Amalah in the hospital so he could go home to shower and change clothes. That last month, it seemed she was always near. The two women had been best friends all their lives, and they would be to the end.<br><br>Staten didn't smile as he cut the engine in front of Quinn O'Grady's house. He never smiled. Not anymore. For years he'd worked hard thinking he'd be passing on the Double K to his son. Now, if Staten died, the ranch would probably be sold at auction to help support his father's run for the senate or, who knows, the old guy might run for governor next time. Even though Samuel Kirkland was in his sixties, his fourth wife was keeping him young, he claimed. He'd never had much interest in the ranch and hadn't spent a night on Kirkland soil since Staten had taken over the place.<br><br>Quinn caught Staten's attention as she opened her door and stared out at him. She had a big towel in one hand as she leaned against the door frame and waited for him to climb out of the truck and come inside. She was tall, almost six feet, and ordinary in her simple clothes. He couldn't imagine Quinn in heels or her hair fixed any way except the long braid she always wore down the center of her back. She'd worn jeans since she started school; only, there had been two braids trailing down her back then.<br><br><em>Funny,</em> Staten thought as he climbed out and tried to outrun the rain, <em>a woman who wants nothing to do with frills or lace lives in a dollhouse.</em><br><br>After he reached the porch and shook like a big dog, she handed him the towel. "When I saw the storm moving in, I figured you'd be coming. Tug off those muddy boots while I dip up some soup for supper. I made taco soup when I saw the clouds rolling in from the north."<br><br>No one ordered any Kirkland around. No one. Only here, in her house, he did what she asked. He might never have another drop of love in him, but he'd still respect Quinn.<br><br>His spurs jingled as his boots hit the porch. In his stocking feet he stood only a few inches taller than her, but with his broad shoulders he guessed he probably doubled her in weight. "Any chance the clouds made you think of coconut pie?"<br><br>She laughed softly. "It's in the oven. Be out in a minute."<br><br>They watched the stormy afternoon turn into evening, with lightning putting on a show outside her kitchen window. He liked how he felt comfortable being silent around her. They sometimes talked about Amalah and the funny things that had happened when they were growing up. He felt as if he and Quinn were the leftovers, for the best of them had both died with Amalah.<br><br>Only, tonight his thoughts were on his son, and Staten didn't really want to talk at all. As the sun set, the temperature dropped, and the icy rain turned to a dusting of soft mushy snow while they ate in silence.<br><br>When he reached for his dishes and started to stand, she stopped him with a touch on his damp sleeve. "I'll do that," she said. "Finish your coffee."<br><br>He sat quiet and still for a few minutes, thinking how this place of hers seemed to slow his heart and make it easier to breathe. He finally left the table and silently moved to stand behind her as she worked at the sink. With rough hands scabbed over in places where the reins had cut, he began to untie her braid.<br><br>"I did this once when we were in third grade. I remember you didn't say a word, but Amalah called me an idiot after school."<br><br>Quinn nodded but didn't speak. Shared memories settled comfortably between them.<br><br>He liked the way Quinn's sunshine hair felt, even now. It was thick and hung down straight except for the slight waves left by the braid.<br><br>She turned and frowned up at him as she took his hand. Without asking questions she pulled his injured palm under running water and then patted it dry. When she rubbed lotion over his hand, it felt more like a caress than doctoring.<br><br>He was so close behind her their bodies brushed as she worked. Leaning down, he tickled her neck with a light kiss. "Play for me tonight," he whispered.<br><br>Turning toward the old piano across the open living area, she shook her head. "I can't."<br><br>He didn't question or try to change her mind. He never did. Sometimes, she'd play for him, other times something deep inside her wouldn't let her.<br><br>Without a word, she tugged him to the only bedroom, turning off lights as they moved through the house.<br><br>For a while he stood at the doorway, watching her remove her plain work clothes: worn jeans, a faded plaid shirt that probably belonged to her father years ago and a T-shirt that hugged her slender frame. As piece by piece fell, pale white skin glowed in the low light of her nightstand.<br><br>When he didn't move, she turned toward him. Her breasts were small, her body lean, her tummy flat from never bearing a child. All she wore was a pair of red panties.<br><br>"Finish undressing me," she whispered, then waited.<br><br>He walked toward her, knowing that he wouldn't have moved if she hadn't invited him. Maybe it was just a game they played, or maybe they'd silently agreed on unwritten rules when they'd begun. He couldn't remember.<br><br>Pulling her against him, he just held her for a long time. Somehow on that worst night of his life five years ago, he'd knocked at her door. He'd been muddy, grieving and lost to himself.<br><br>She hadn't said a word. She'd just taken his hand. He'd let her pull off his muddy clothes and clean him up while he tried to think of a way to stop breathing and die. She'd tucked him into her bed and then climbed in with him, holding him until he finally fell asleep. He hadn't said a word, either, guessing that she'd heard the news reports of the crash. Knowing by the sorrow in her light blue eyes that she shared his grief.<br><br>A thousand feelings had careened through his mind that night, all dark, but she'd held on to him. He remembered thinking that if she had tried to comfort him with words, even a few, he would have shattered into a million pieces.<br><br>Just before dawn, he remembered waking and turning to her. She'd welcomed him, not as a lover, but as a friend silently letting him know it was all right to touch her. All right to hold on.<br><br>In the five years since, they'd had long talks, sometimes when he sought her out. They'd had stormy nights when they didn't talk at all. He always made love to her with a gentle touch, never hurried, always with more caring and less passion than he would have liked. Somehow, it felt right that way.<br><br>She wasn't interested in going out on a date or meeting him anywhere. She never called or emailed. If she passed him in the little town that sat between them called Crossroads, she'd wave, but they never spoke more than a few words in public. She had no interest in changing her last name for his, even if he'd asked.<br><br>Yet, he knew her body. He knew what she liked him to do and how she wanted to be held. He knew how she slept, rolled up beside him as if she were cold.<br><br>Only, he didn't know her favorite color or why she'd never married or even why sometimes she couldn't go near her piano. In many ways they didn't know each other at all.<br><br>She was his rainy-day woman. When the memories got to him, she was his refuge. When loneliness ached through his body, she was his cure. She saved him simply by being there, by waiting, by loving a man who had no love to give back.<br><br>As the storm raged and calmed, she pulled him into her bed. They made love in the silence of the evening, and then he held her against him and slept.</p><h2>Cave Paintings Of Baja California: Discovering the Great Murals of an Unknown People</h2><p>The Great Murals of Mexico's Baja California are one of the five greatest sites in the world for primitive rock art. They rank with those of southern France, northern Spain, northwest Africa, and outback Australia. These Great Murals, created by an unknown people, are without doubt the most distinctive trove of rock art in the Western Hemisphere. The site was unveiled to the modern world in the 1960s by adventure/mystery writer Erle Stanley Gardner who brought in UCLA archaeologist Clement Meighan to validate the importance of his find. But it was not until the 1970s, when author/photographer Harry W. Crosby undertook a systematic search for the largely unknown works hidden in the mountains of central Baja that the scope and significance of the find became known. He documented his search and discovery of over 200 previously unreported rock art sites leading to the original publication of The Cave Paintings of Baja California by Copley Books in 1975 which first introduced this cave art to the general public. Since that time, Baja California's Great Murals have been designated a United Nations Heritage Site. <p> This lavishly illustrated full-color account is greatly revised and expanded from the original edition and offers Crosby's unique perspective on the painted sites and painting styles found in different parts of the Great Mural area. Crosby's explorations, studies and writings since his original forays into the mountains of central Baja California have established him as one of the foremost authorities on Baja California's colorful past. This is the most complete treatment of this world-class archaeological site currently available.</p><p> Every year, more and more professional researchers, rock art aficionados, and curious tourists visit the caves and rock shelters of Baja California. To them as well as the armchair traveler, this is an invaluable reference work, field guide and adventure narrative to the magnificent art that survives on this rugged peninsula. This is a classic that will be read by the specialist and general reader for years to come.</p><p> The Cave Paintings of Baja California was named a selection of the Book-of-the-Month Club, History Book Club, and the Natural History Book Club. The book is endorsed by the Mexican government. Contributing photographer is Enrique Hambleton. Specifications: 246 pages; 10" x 10" hardbound with dust jacket; 71 full color photographs; 11 black and white photographs; 8 full color maps; 6 black and white maps; and 108 full color illustrations; bibliography; index; glossary of technical, colloquial, and Spanish terms.</p></p><p>Interest in the Great Mural area stimulated by the publication of this book has led to the production of a one-hour television documentary being created by Tamarisk Group which is slated to air nationally sometime in 1999. The author, Harry W. Crosby, will be featured in this documentary.Crosby's prose style might be described as "scholarly," but the text is enlivened by the way he weaves together his story of the painters and their world and his own journey of discovery, mostly on mule back, through the hinterlands and among the occupants of the long Baja peninsula...But it is the photographs and maps that bring this book, and its subjects, to life. They speak with eloquent power, giving voice to the past, to a people whose arrival and departure will ever by a mystery. The reader is moved to travel there, despite the distance and discomforts, to gaze, to smile and to wonder. -- Richard Sterling -- <i>Historic Traveler Magazine, 4/98, Richard Sterling </i><br><br>Frankly, I found the book one of the most remarkable ever to be published. Harry Crosby has opened a wonderful window to the past. For this impressive book, he found and photographed 200 previously undiscovered rock shelters painted in the Great Mural style. CAVE PAINTINGS OF BAJA CALIFORNIA is a labor of love. -- <i>Hispanic Times Magazine, 5-6/98, Robert Kendall </i><br><br>It is certainly fitting that this book should have been selected by the Book of the Month Club as one of its history selections. Harry Crosby is certainly to be congratulated as are his publishers -- the later having clearly risked a lot of capital on this lavish investment. It is a large scale, yet personal and intimate, book of scientific description, of scholarship, and of great beauty. So is it now and forever the foundation on which all future studies of Baja California rock art will stand. -- Bernard L. Fontana -- <i>Southwestern Mission Research Center Newsletter Bernard L. Fontana </i><br><br>The cave gods must be looking over Sunbelt's shoulder. Since it was released in February, CAVE PAINTINGS was selected for three book clubs, reviewed favorably in the top review journals, and mentioned in the WALL STREET JOURNAL. That's not all. An Emmy-award winning producer is taping a one-hour, TV documentary to be aired in 1999. The documentary will gather together experts to talk about this world wonder. -- <i>Foreword Magazine, 6/98</i><br><br>The greatest concentration of prehistoric cave paintings in the Western Hemisphere did not come to public attention until the latter part of our own century. In the mountains of central Baja California, on volcanic overhangs over labyrinthine canyons, loom scenes up to 150 feet long and 35 feet high, of deer, mountain sheep, birds, snakes, even whales and manta rays, as well as humans, male and female. Figures are stylized in red and black, occasionally ochre and white, with image heaped on top of image, giving a sense of life teeming and frozen where one expects bare stone. How did a people who left no evidence of the most rudimentary agriculture, no trace of shelter for themselves, manage to execute sophisticated murals that soared six times their own height? Who, for that matter, were those people? <p> It is cause for celebration that the best popular work on the subject in English is back in print. Harry Crosby, author of several works on the peninsula, including most recently, a compendious history of the missionary period, first published his narrative of the cave paintings in 1975. In less thorough fashion, the paintings had already been written about by Jesuit padres, a French mining engineer, mystery writer Erle Stanley Gardner, and a scattering of archaeologists, and the murals themselves had been familiar all along to the ranchers who live among them. With those ranchers for companions and guides, Crosby made it his goal to find and catalog them all. His account is anything but pedantic. Slightly revised for reasons of style more than content, it conveys the excitement of the search while pausing for portraits of ranchers, observations on pack --<i>The Bloomsbury Review, 5-6/98</i></p></p><h2>Woman of Valor: Clara Barton and the Civil War</h2><p><b>A stunning biography of Clara Barton&#x2014;a woman who determined to serve her country during the Civil War&#x2014;from acclaimed author Stephen B. Oates.</b><br><br>When the Civil War broke out, Clara Barton wanted more than anything to be a Union soldier, an impossible dream for a thirty-nine-year-old woman, who stood a slender five feet tall. Determined to serve, she became a veritable soldier, a nurse, and a one-woman relief agency operating in the heart of the conflict. Now, award-winning author Stephen B. Oates, drawing on archival materials not used by her previous biographers, has written the first complete account of Clara Barton&#x2019;s active engagement in the Civil War.<br> <br>By the summer of 1862, with no institutional affiliation or official government appointment, but impelled by a sense of duty and a need to heal, she made her way to the front lines and the heat of battle. Oates tells the dramatic story of this woman who gave the world a new definition of courage, supplying medical relief to the wounded at some of the most famous battles of the war&#x2014;including Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg, Battery Wagner, the Wilderness, Spotsylvania, and Petersburg. Under fire with only her will as a shield, she worked while ankle deep in gore, in hellish makeshift battlefield hospitals&#x2014;a bullet-riddled farmhouse, a crumbling mansion, a windblown tent.

If there was anything she hated, it was shopping for jeans. With all the boot-cut, slim, straight, bell, stonewashed, low-rise, high-rise styles, and ever changing lengths, finding a pair that fit properly was a challenge. Harsh lighting didn&#x2019;t exactly add to the joy of the occasion.<br> <br>A deliberate pounding on the door was followed by a cheery, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s Turquoise. Any luck yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>Regan glanced at the pile of jeans she&#x2019;d already rejected. &#x201c;I think so,&#x201d; she answered, trying to sound upbeat.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s that? You need to speak up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Of course I do, Regan realized. &#x201c;Yes, finally,&#x201d; she called over the thumping music that filled the air.<br> <br>&#x201c;Awesome! Can I take a peek?&#x201d;<br> <br>Oy, Regan realized. This is the part of shopping I hate the most. She didn&#x2019;t have to be psychic to predict the salesgirl&#x2019;s reaction. Regan pulled open the door.<br> <br>Turquoise, not her legal name, she&#x2019;d informed Regan, although Regan might have guessed, had streaks of turquoise running through her wildly layered black hair. One small section looked as if she&#x2019;d been to the barber for a close shave. Another section was cascading down to her waist. The black leather halter and low-rise jeans Turquoise was sporting brought to mind the expression, &#x201c;And never the twain shall meet.&#x201d; She quickly sized up Regan&#x2019;s jeans. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re fab! Oh, I wish I were tall like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;5'7" isn&#x2019;t that tall,&#x201d; Regan said with a smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;It is to me! If I didn&#x2019;t wear these platform shoes,&#x201d; Turquoise said, pointing to her indescribable footwear, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d disappear into the crowd.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not a chance,&#x201d; Regan answered.<br> <br>Turquoise laughed and swayed back and forth to the thumping music. &#x201c;I have one more pair that you have to try on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Regan began. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;m done for the day.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, wait! I&#x2019;m so psyched. I thought we were out of this style but I found one last pair in the back and it&#x2019;s your size! You&#x2019;re going to love them.&#x201d; Turquoise reverently unfolded the jeans in her hand and held them out. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t these cool?&#x201d;<br> <br>Regan stared. The jeans had holes in the knees the size of bread plates. Holes surrounded by fray. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s what I&#x2019;m looking for.&#x201d;<br> <br>Regan felt decidedly unhip. She was thirty-one years old but suddenly being around Turquoise made her feel at least a hundred.<br> <br>&#x201c;You never know until you try,&#x201d; Turquoise said with a twinkle in her heavily made-up eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s true of a lot of things in life,&#x201d; Regan said, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;ll take a pass.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No prob. Would you like to put your purchase on your Trendsetters credit card?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, thanks,&#x201d; Regan said quickly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you have a Trendsetters credit card?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Would you like to apply for one today? You&#x2019;ll get ten percent off.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, really. But thanks. I&#x2019;ll get changed and be right out.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. I&#x2019;ll meet you out front.&#x201d;<br> <br>Regan pulled off the jeans, started to lose her balance, and stepped on one of the straight pins that she had been carefully avoiding. &#x201c;Ow,&#x201d; she grumbled as she pressed her hand against the wall to steady herself. I&#x2019;ve got to get out of here, she thought. She checked her foot to see if there was any blood before she slipped on the white pants that had felt chic before she set foot in the store. At the register, as Turquoise rang up the purchase, she asked for Regan&#x2019;s e-mail address and phone number. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll get advance word on Trendsetters sales!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d rather not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you sure? You might miss out on some really super deals.&#x201d;<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a risk, Regan thought, but a risk I&#x2019;m willing to take. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure,&#x201d; she replied as she signed the credit card receipt.<br> <br>Turquoise folded the jeans and placed them in a plastic bag. The words &#x201c;Come back soon,&#x201d; had barely escaped her lips before she hurried off to greet an attractive, conservatively dressed woman in her fifties who had just come through the door.<br> <br>Good luck, lady, Regan thought, as she escaped into the California sunshine and donned her sunglasses.<br> <br>Regan walked along the upscale outdoor mall that was a welcome addition to the Los Angeles shopping scene. A large, modern timepiece towering over the fountain that was the centerpiece of the mall read October 4th, 4:05 P.M. The warm air and the softening of the afternoon light calmed her. And just being out of that dressing room was a relief! But Regan was ready to head back to the hotel.<br> <br>Private investigator Regan Reilly had lived in Los Angeles when she met Jack Reilly, head of the NYPD Major Case Squad. The occasion? The kidnapping of Regan&#x2019;s father, Luke, along with his driver. Regan and Jack had worked, along with his team, on getting them back safely. The two had been together ever since. People often laughed about how convenient it was they both had the same last name, then invariably added that they looked like they were made for each other.<br> <br>Regan&#x2019;s dark hair, blue eyes, and light skin were termed &#x201c;Black Irish.&#x201d; 6'2" Jack was sandy-haired, hazel-eyed, and what Regan termed &#x201c;incredibly handsome.&#x201d; They had an apartment in Tribeca&#x2014;the triangle below Canal Street&#x2014;in New York City. Her parents, Nora Regan Reilly, a well-known mystery writer, and Luke, owner of three funeral homes, lived in Summit, New Jersey, where Regan had grown up. Luke loved to take the credit for introducing them. &#x201c;If I hadn&#x2019;t been kidnapped, . . . &#x201d; he&#x2019;d joke, his face beaming with pride. &#x201c;Anything for my daughter.&#x201d;<br> <br>So much about my life has changed since I left L.A., Regan thought as she headed for the multistoried parking structure. It&#x2019;s hard to believe I was living here not so long ago. It&#x2019;s good to be back for a visit, especially since I&#x2019;m with Jack.<br> <br>They&#x2019;d arrived late the night before on a last-minute trip. For the next few days Jack would be meeting with the LAPD, then they would take off in their rental car. Perhaps head north to wine country for the weekend. Perhaps south to Baja. See which way the wind blew, that was their plan.<br> <br>Regan decided to stop for a moment and sit on a bench near the fountain and check her phone. The fountain that not only gushed water, but played music. Miracles will never cease, she thought as she reached in her purse. Jack had texted her. No surprise that I never heard my phone in that store. She read his message:<br><br>Looks like today&#x2019;s meeting will run well into the evening. Giving you a heads-up so you can make dinner plans with one of your old pals. I love you. Jack.<br><br>Regan felt a stab of disappointment. I shouldn&#x2019;t, she thought. His work is the reason we&#x2019;re here. She put her cell phone back in her purse, stood up, and once again started toward the parking lot. A slender woman wearing a long skirt and peasant blouse was a few steps ahead of Regan, moving quickly, carrying several shopping bags in each hand. A small brown bag at the top of one of them fell to the ground. Regan scooped it up, caught up to the woman, and tapped her on the shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me,&#x201d; Regan said. &#x201c;You just dropped this.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman slowed down and turned to Regan. She was wearing large sunglasses. &#x201c;Huh?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This just fell out of one of your bags.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, thank you! That is so nice of you,&#x201d; she said, putting her bags on the ground. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m rushing too much.&#x201d; She took the bag from Regan, then tried to fit it in with her other purchases but there wasn&#x2019;t enough room. &#x201c;Oh, my,&#x201d; she mumbled.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re going to your car, I&#x2019;ll help you,&#x201d; Regan offered.<br> <br>The woman shook her head vehemently as she continued to try and rearrange her bags. &#x201c;Oh, no, that&#x2019;s okay. I can handle it.&#x201d;<br> <br>She must be afraid I&#x2019;m some kind of con artist, Regan thought with amusement. &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going to let your old game show friend help you out?&#x201d; Regan teased.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; The woman quickly glanced up at Regan.<br> <br>&#x201c;As I recall, we had a lot of laughs the few days we spent together at the television studio in Burbank waiting our chance to wow the world on <i>Puzzling Words</i>.&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman straightened up and screamed. &#x201c;Regan?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Zelda!&#x201d;<br> <br>They hugged, then both took off their sunglasses. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry I didn&#x2019;t recognize you,&#x201d; Zelda stammered as she pushed back her mane of brown curls. Beads of sweat had formed on her forehead. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m in such a hurry.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s okay. It must be about seven or eight years. You look great.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks, you too! Neither of us won the big money but we both came so close!&#x201d; Zelda cried. &#x201c;And remember that horrible clue your celebrity gave you when you were playing for twenty grand?&#x201d;<br> <br>Regan laughed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll never forget it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You were in detective school. We exchanged numbers but never got in touch.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I called you once,&#x201d; Regan teased. &#x201c;But I never heard back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. My life was in such confusion. First I was so upset about not winning the money, then I thought too much time had passed to call you back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; Regan said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that a wedding ring you&#x2019;re wearing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. And I live in New York now. We&#x2019;re out here for my husband&#x2019;s work.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wonderful! I&#x2019;m still looking for the right guy. Maybe I&#x2019;ll meet him before I turn forty. That gives me three months! But I&#x2019;ve had a few good things happen in my life since I last saw you. . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>They walked to Zelda&#x2019;s car, during which time Regan learned that Zelda had been left $8 million by an elderly neighbor she barely knew.<br> <br>&#x201c;Eight million dollars!&#x201d; Regan gasped.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can you believe it? This woman lived in my apartment building. She was a loner. I always said hello when we passed each other in the hallway, I held the door for her, and when she wasn&#x2019;t feeling well I offered to walk her dog. She let me do that a few times but wasn&#x2019;t interested in even having a cup of tea together. After she died, I was flabbergasted she left me anything, never mind that much. My building was nice, but not the kind of place where you&#x2019;d imagine someone down the hall had at least eight million dollars in the bank.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess it makes up for losing on the game show,&#x201d; Regan remarked.<br> <br>&#x201c;It does,&#x201d; Zelda said. She laughed heartily, instantly bringing Regan back to those days in the studio. Not a single bad clue went without comment. Zelda and Regan both prayed Betty White would be their celebrity partner. No such luck.<br> <br>&#x201c;So when did you become a multimillionaire?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Almost a year ago.&#x201d; They reached Zelda&#x2019;s Mercedes and loaded the bags in her trunk. &#x201c;Listen, Regan, I have to hurry. This week I&#x2019;m staying in an old Hollywood Hills estate. I don&#x2019;t think anyone has lived there in years. The owner donated the use of the house for a week, as a prize at a charity auction. I bid the most&#x2014;which isn&#x2019;t saying much because nobody else wanted it. I&#x2019;m having a dinner party tonight. Why don&#x2019;t you and your husband come along?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jack is working.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So come by yourself. The place is a kick. There are hiking trails next to the property. I was thinking of suggesting a moonlit walk after dinner if people are up to it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That sounds great, Zelda. What time?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;8:00.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be there,&#x201d; Regan said as she wrote down the address. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s so funny to run into you like this.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was meant to be, Regan. I truly believe that. I&#x2019;ve been studying the universe. Everything happens for a reason. I coach people on that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Coach people?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m a life coach. I&#x2019;ll tell you about it tonight. Can I give you a ride to your car?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, thanks, it&#x2019;s up on the next level. It&#x2019;s easier to walk.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay. See you later.&#x201d;<br> <br>Regan waved as Zelda backed out her car. Wow, Regan thought. What a story. She turned, and immediately noticed a tall, scruffy guy wearing a baseball cap and jeans coming into the garage from one of the side stairwells, a set of keys in his hand. Anxiously, he glanced around. Regan watched as he rushed down one aisle, up the next, then tried a key in the passenger door of a small car. It didn&#x2019;t work. Quickly he backed away. He walked up another aisle and tried the key again with no luck.<br> <br>What is he doing? Is he looking for a car to steal? Regan asked herself. Most people have at least some idea of where they parked their car. Surreptitiously Regan followed him as he went up and down the aisles looking around, then headed for the main staircase and hurried down the steps. Her heart beating fast, Regan followed after him to the lower level where he also scouted out cars. She tried to keep her distance, but when he started back toward the main stairwell he seemed to sense her presence, stopped, and glanced around. Their eyes met.<br> <br>People were strolling to their cars, unaware of what was going on. I can&#x2019;t put anyone in danger, Regan thought as she quickly turned and started to walk away. A moment later she turned back.<br> <br>He was gone.<br> <br>Regan headed to the security office as fast as she could.</p><h2>Palaces for the People: How To Build a More Equal and United Society</h2><p><b>How can we bring people together?

His illuminating and accessible discussion is a characteristically skillful and compelling synthesis of hard scientific theory, factual evidence, personal anecdotes, haunting reflection, and poetic prose.</p><p>The quest to understand humankind's place in the universe is an old one, perhaps as old as the human species itself. That quest is tinged with science, but also with magic, for, writes the paleontologist Loren Eiseley (1907-1977), a human being "is both pragmatist and mystic. He has been so since the beginning, and it may well be that the quality of his inquiring and perceptive intellect will cause him to remain so till the end."<p> In this lively, literate set of essays, originally delivered in 1959 as a lecture series at the University of Cincinnati, Eiseley traces the history of science, giving special attention to the 18th and 19th centuries, which witnessed the rise of a kind of scientific inquiry that crossed narrow disciplines. Building on the ideas of Newton and Laplace, for instance, the Scottish scientist James Hutton developed the foundations of historical geology; Hutton's doctoral work had not been in physics but physiology, and his dissertation concerned the circulation of the blood, from which he evidently hit on the idea of considering the earth as a living organism. Eiseley moves on to discuss trends in evolutionary thought, putting in good words for such neglected figures as Jean Lamarck, a "much maligned thinker [who] glimpsed ecological change and adjustment before Darwin." Eiseley's explorations end with an admonition that our scientific understanding may well have outpaced our moral evolution, leading to the danger that "we have created an unbearable last idol for our worship"--namely, ourselves. His wise words remain compelling reading today. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Loren Eiseley (1907&#x2013;1977), naturalist, essayist, philosopher, and poet, won the John Burroughs Medal for best publication in the field of nature writing in 1961 for <i>The Firmament of Time</i>.&nbsp;Introducer Gary Holthaus, a freelance poet and writer, is the author of <i>Wide Skies: Finding a Home in the West.</i></p><h2>Genetic Roulette: The Documented Health Risks of Genetically Engineered Foods</h2><p><p><strong>Eating genetically modified food is gambling with every bite.</strong></p> <p>The biotech industry's claim that genetically modified (GM) foods are safe is shattered in this groundbreaking book.

They can&#x2019;t really be held responsible for what they do. But we can.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;from <i>The Dogs of Bedlam Farm</i><br></b><br>When Jon Katz adopted a border collie named Orson, his whole world changed. Gone were the two yellow Labs he wrote about in <i>A Dog Year,</i> as was the mountaintop cabin they loved. Katz moved into an old farmhouse on forty-two acres of pasture and woods with a menagerie: a ram named Nesbitt, fifteen ewes, a lonely donkey named Carol, a baby donkey named Fanny, and three border collies. <br><br>Training Orson was a demanding project. But a perceptive dog trainer and friend told Katz: &#x201c;If you want to have a better dog, you will just have to be a better goddamned human.&#x201d; It was a lesson Katz took to heart. He now sees his dogs as a reflection of his willingness to improve, as well as a critical reminder of his shortcomings. Katz shows us that dogs are often what we make them: They may have their own traits and personalities, but in the end, they are mirrors of our own lives&#x2013;living, breathing testaments to our strengths and frustrations, our families and our pasts.<br><br><i>The Dogs of Bedlam Farm</i> recounts a harrowing winter Katz spent on a remote, windswept hillside in upstate New York with a few life-saving friends, ugly ghosts from the past, and more livestock than any novice should attempt to manage. Heartwarming, and full of drama, insight, and hard-won wisdom, it is the story of his several dogs forced Katz to confront his sense of humanity, and how he learned the places a dog could lead him and the ways a doge could change him.</p><p><b>JON KATZ</b> has written thirteen books-&#x2013;six novels and seven works of nonfiction, including <i>A Dog Year</i> and <i>The New Work of Dogs.</i> A two-time finalist for the National Magazine Award, he has written for <i>The New York Times,</i> the <i>Wall Street Journal, Rolling Stone,</i> and the <i>AKC Gazette.</i> A member of the Association of Pet Dog Trainers, he writes a column about dogs for the online magazine <i>Slate</i> and is co-host of &#x201c;Dog Talk,&#x201d; a monthly show on Northeast Public Radio. Katz lives on Bedlam Farm in upstate New York and in northern New Jersey, with his wife Paula Span, a <i>Washington Post</i> contributing writer and teacher at Columbia University, and their dogs.

From this hill behind my new house, I could spot visitors approaching from miles away.<br><br>There were plenty of farms around this quadrant of upstate New York, lots of places livestock haulers might be going, but my guess was that this was Wilbur Price of Bethel, Pennsylvania, delivering a ram named Nesbitt and the ladies, fifteen &#x201c;dog-broke&#x201d; ewes.<br><br>Which meant it was time to walk down the hill. Change was just around the corner, big change.<br><br>For three border collies, there could be no more meaningful event than the arrival of sheep in their backyard. For me, the change was more complex, but a big transition nonetheless, another midlife crapshoot. I was stepping out of one existence and into another, a shift inexorably linked to these three dogs.<br><br>We all clambered down the hill as the trailer descended into town. In a few minutes, this farm, known around the county as the old Keyes place&#x2014;somehow I doubted it would ever be known as the old Katz place&#x2014;with its listing and peeling dairy barn, an even more askew pig barn, an overgrown chicken pen, and several other outbuildings, would be home once again to livestock. Everyone in the tiny village could look up the hill and see animals grazing, as they had for generations.<br><br>I was no farmer, and this place wouldn&#x2019;t really qualify as a working farm. I am a dog lover and writer, and this would be, in part, a dog-centric adventure with my border collies. Even before the animals arrived, in the few weeks since I&#x2019;d moved in and begun preparations, I could hardly believe the amount of work involved just in overseeing forty-two acres and a Civil War&#x2013;era farmhouse. I could only imagine how difficult and relentless real farmwork was, particularly in brutal winter. My work would be fractional in comparison, and I wouldn&#x2019;t rely on the farm to provide my family&#x2019;s livelihood&#x2014;an enormous difference.<br><br>Wilbur, a garrulous man in a giant baseball cap and overalls, was indeed waiting at the gravel driveway with his noisy cargo. We shook hands and chatted about the weather and the drive and his dicey encounters with fog en route. Wilbur, I realized, drove sheep and cows around all day and didn&#x2019;t want to pass up the chance for a more satisfying conversation.<br><br>I, on the other hand, was eager to populate my farm and get it rolling. After considerable effort and dismaying expense, I had fences up, hay and straw in the barn, and corn and feed stashed in critter-proof containers all over. I was as ready as somebody like me was ever going to be. But I&#x2019;d learned that country talk can&#x2019;t be rushed. It had to have been a long and lonely ride up from Raspberry Ridge, my friend Carolyn&#x2019;s sheep farm and dog-training center. These ewes were loaners from her much larger flock.<br><br>We knew these sheep. My elder dogs and I, frequent visitors and herding students at Raspberry Ridge, had taken them to graze in the pasture countless times in rain and sunshine, in deep night and bright day, heat and cold. We&#x2019;d moved them around during herding trials, chased them during our lessons, retrieved them from the woods when they wandered, midwifed a few of their lambs. We also knew&#x2014;and were appropriately wary of&#x2014;Nesbitt, who&#x2019;d sent me flying more than once.<br><br>I could hear them all shifting and bleating in the trailer, probably hungry and thirsty. I heard an asthmatic-sounding bray, too, which meant that at the last minute Carolyn had decided to send the donkey along with the rest of the crew. The donkey lived alone in a pasture, and Carolyn thought she might have a better quality of life at my new encampment. Carol, the donkey, was a sweetheart, whose affections I&#x2019;d won with gifts of apples; I wondered if she&#x2019;d recognize me in this strange new environment.<br><br>Wilbur finally sensed that it was time to get moving. He slowly backed the truck a few feet inside the barnyard gate and slipped the latches that opened his trailer.<br><br>Carol the Lonely Donkey hee-hawed again, looked around, snarfed down the donkey cookie I was holding out for her, and trotted down the ramp. She did seem to remember me, and in any case appreciated the cookie.<br><br>Behind her, fifteen sheep and Nesbitt came charging past me, headed for the lush grass that covered the hill, and immediately started crunching away. Unlike dogs, sheep are not complex in their attachments. Grass is good. Grass is always good.<br><br>I shook Wilbur&#x2019;s hand and wrote out a check on the cab of his truck. Bedlam Farm was in business.<br><br>My dogs, corralled in their own spacious fenced enclosure a few yards away, sat frozen; they seemed shocked, wide-eyed, ears and tails at the alert. One rarely sees a more focused look on any creature than I saw on the faces of Orson, Homer, and Rose.<br><br>The autumn wind was sharp, parting the mists on the hill. I looked up to see a small flock of sheep and a donkey grazing near an old apple tree. I could hardly believe it myself; they looked as if they had grown out of the ground and had been there forever. Wilbur declined coffee and other amenities, saying he wanted to be home for dinner, and after much rattling, banging, and slamming, the truck rumbled off down the dirt road into town, back to the world.<br><br>It was one thing to drive out and work with Carolyn&#x2019;s sheep once or twice a week from suburban New Jersey, where much of the time my dogs and I lived an ordinary-looking life with my wife. It was quite another to be responsible for sheep living just outside my kitchen window.<br><br>They would need shots and worming and medical certificates from a vet. They would need to be shorn, to have their hooves trimmed. They&#x2019;d need corn to build up calories for the winter, vitamin supplements when the ewes got pregnant, straw to lie on, and hay to eat once the grass withered in the first hard frost. They needed a continuous supply of fresh water, even in sub-zero weather.<br><br>In a few months, their newborn lambs would need to be located instantly, dried, and placed under heating lamps, separate from the rest of the flock. Lambs often required special supplements, and they&#x2019;d need to be tagged and registered and have their tails docked. And everyone would need shelter from the vicious winter storms that would be arriving in just a few weeks.<br><br>All of these things had to be provided when the ice was packed a foot deep on the ground amid waist-high mounds of snow. And I had to&#x2014;wanted to&#x2014;take care of almost all those things myself.<br><br>When we bought this place, my wife, Paula, had set down three ironclad conditions: no firearms; no farm or other heavy machinery; and the gargantuan 1982 Chevy Silverado pickup I&#x2019;d bought for hauling hay and other farm chores was not to be driven more than five miles in any direction. She was convinced that it would break down at inconvenient times; I had to be able to walk home.<br><br>Anybody who knew me understood the wisdom of these conditions. So while I would need help with barn repairs, drainage ditches, anything involving heavy machinery, the work was otherwise mine to do.<br><br>So as Wilbur drove out of sight and I waved goodbye, I was elated but also unnerved. There was no going back.<br><br>Our day had begun much earlier, around five a.m., with our new morning routine. Orson, Homer, and the puppy, Rose, had labored up the steep hill behind the house with me, the wind whipping around us, tearing leaves off the trees at the top of the ridge. Even in the forbidding predawn, I could scarcely believe I owned such a beautiful tract of countryside. I could hear the occasional yip-yip of coyotes&#x2014;&#x201c;coy dogs,&#x201d; the locals call them&#x2014;and wondered how soon they would be circling my soon-to-<br><br>arrive sheep.<br><br>To be honest, I was the only one laboring up the hill, heading for two Adirondack chairs placed at the crest. The dogs were racing and gliding effortlessly, zipping around in enthusiastic circles the way border collies go everywhere&#x2014;back and forth, round and round, always somehow keeping me in the center. I&#x2019;d become used to walking in this odd way, aware vaguely that I was being herded. The two adults, Orson and Homer, had plenty of energy, but Rose positively zoomed, galloping from one corner of the pasture to the other in the time it took me to go a few steps.<br><br>Every dog has a story, but Orson&#x2019;s is better known than some. A breeder in Texas had retrieved him from someone she deemed an unsuitable owner, then sent him to me after reading one of my books, in which I talked about my late, beloved yellow Labs. Orson, then named Devon, was a dog in trouble. He was anxious, confused, apt to jump onto passing minivans, herd school buses, raid the refrigerator and jump through windows; we brawled until I found a great trainer&#x2014;Carolyn&#x2014;who helped turn our lives around.<br><br>He was followed by Homer, as sweet and submissive as Orson was difficult, but a dog who presented challenges of his own. Then a few months ago, our pack had been joined by Rose, the nuclear-powered puppy with strong herding lines who made the other two seem like stone statues. People ask me why I got a third border collie, and the truth is I hardly know. I still can&#x2019;t quite explain why I got the first one.<br><br>&#x201c;Guys, this will be a great day for you,&#x201d; I announced. &#x201c;Soon there will be fifteen ewes in this field, along with a grumpy ram named Nesbitt and maybe a donkey. You&#x2019;ve got to watch out for Nesbitt. He&#x2019;ll nail me.&#x201d;<br><br>It had only been a couple of months since I had put my cherished mountaintop retreat&#x2014;a cabin where I&#x2019;d written three books and found more peace and beauty than I&#x2019;d ever known&#x2014;up for sale. I wanted to buy an old farmhouse with a porch, some land, maybe a barn. Through a series of flukes, I&#x2019;d gotten more than I&#x2019;d bargained for, more acreage, a lovelier house, more barns in more advanced stages of decay, along with coyotes, hawks and songbirds, yellow jackets and fleas, feral cats, rats and mice (despite the feral cats), raccoons, chipmunks, foxes, loads of deer, and unconfirmed rumors of two moose and a mountain lion. I also had a sweeping view of a lush valley checkered with pastures, cornfields, and barns.<br><br>The classic white Greek revival farmhouse had seen a lot of history. It sat on a hillside above a tiny hamlet of thirty or forty houses, two lovely old churches, and a general store&#x2014;Bedlam&#x2019;s Corner. The name mesmerized me from the moment I first drove by.<br><br>My earlier cabin, a half hour south of Hebron, was a getaway, a private corner for a writer&#x2019;s internal life. I worked there, read, hiked with the dogs. Apart from my wife and daughter and two or three friends, hardly anyone else had ever seen it. That was part of the problem; it was my place and only my place.<br><br>As much as I&#x2019;d loved it, as important as it had become, the cabin had also defeated me in a way. It was so small that there was barely enough space for the dogs and me; it felt crowded when my wife visited, let alone my daughter Emma. I had come to want not a retreat for me, but a rural home for us, with places for Paula to work and Emma to stay, with space for friends&#x2014;a place for liveliness more than solitary contemplation. I felt ready for a fuller existence, though I had no inkling just how full it was about to get.<br><br>I was conscious, as I try always to be, of entering another phase, of marking the transition and pondering how I was going to deal with it. I&#x2019;d just turned fifty-six. How many more houses would I be buying? How many more dogs could I ever own? How much more time did Paula and I have to be together in a place like this?<br><br>I couldn&#x2019;t really afford the farm any more than I could the cabin that preceded it, but I couldn&#x2019;t really afford to wait, either. For several years, especially since the terrorist attacks on New York City, I&#x2019;d seen people assessing their lives, making changes, seeking property upstate. In another five years I doubted I&#x2019;d be able to buy acreage. My little cabin, forlorn and ungainly at the time, had been on the market for two years when I bought it. It sold in less than a week, once I put it on the market.<br><br>Driving me around the town of Hebron as I looked for the replacement I had in mind, the real estate agent had looked up at the hillside as we passed and pointed at the white farmhouse. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s the house you want,&#x201d; she said ruefully. &#x201c;But it isn&#x2019;t for sale.&#x201d; Three weeks later, it suddenly was. Sometimes houses, like dogs, find you.<br><br>What better place to test my notions about dogs and humans than here, with border collies and a bunch of sheep? Could they become happier dogs and more useful partners? Could I learn to be a better human? The four of us and our little band of animals, tucked away on a hillside through a glorious fall, the bitter upstate winter, and a cold, muddy spring filled with lambing, could probably find out.<br><br>Two months later, I was here, unpacking boxes and dealing with hay supplies, cranky barn doors, monosyllabic Vermont fence builders, and more. It seemed I had compressed years of activities into weeks and days&#x2014;selling a beloved home, buying a more complex one, moving out and in, arranging the endless details that would make it possible for me and my assorted livestock to live here.<br><br>In a few hours, I told the dogs, as we puffed uphill in the dark, there would be sheep right out the back door. The announcement wasn&#x2019;t as loopy as it seemed: every mention of the word &#x201c;sheep&#x201d; got three heads swiveling. Even little Rose, who&#x2019;d visited Raspberry Ridge just a few times, was already hooked and showing quite a bit of herding style.<br><br>I bought the place for my family and me, but my wife pointed out what I privately conceded&#x2014;I bought it for the dogs, as well. Owning land you could barely see the end of was wonderful, but owning property that could give dogs a chance to do and perfect what they most loved, what their breed had done for hundreds of years, that was still another dimension.</p><h2>Barbara Jordan: Speaking the Truth with Eloquent Thunder (Louann Atkins Temple Women &amp; Culture (Louann Atkins Temple Women &amp; Culture Series)</h2><p><p>Revered by Americans across the political spectrum, Barbara Jordan was "the most outspoken moral voice of the American political system," in the words of former President Bill Clinton, who awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1994. Throughout her career as a Texas senator, U.S. congresswoman, and distinguished professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, Barbara Jordan lived by a simple creed: "Ethical behavior means being honest, telling the truth, and doing what you said you were going to do." Her strong stand for ethics in government, civil liberties, and democratic values still provides a standard around which the nation can unite in the twenty-first century.</p> <p>This volume brings together several major political speeches that articulate Barbara Jordan's most deeply held values. They include:</p> <ul> <li>"Erosion of Civil Liberties," a commencement address delivered at Howard University on May 12, 1974, in which Jordan warned that "tyranny in America is possible"</li> <li>"The Constitutional Basis for Impeachment," Jordan's ringing defense of the U.S. Constitution before the House Judiciary Committee investigating the Watergate break-in</li> <li>Keynote addresses to the Democratic National Conventions of 1976 and 1992, in which Jordan set forth her vision of the Democratic Party as an advocate for the common good and a catalyst of change</li> <li>Testimony in the U.S. Congress on the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork and on immigration reform</li> <li>Meditations on faith and politics from two National Prayer Breakfasts</li> <li>Acceptance speech for the 1995 Sylvanus Thayer Award presented by the Association of Graduates of the United States Military Academy, in which Jordan challenged the military to uphold the values of "duty, honor, country"</li> </ul> <p>Accompanying the speeches, some of which readers can also watch on an enclosed DVD, are context-setting introductions by volume editor Max Sherman. The book concludes with the eloquent eulogy that Bill Moyers delivered at Barbara Jordan's memorial service in 1996, in which he summed up Jordan's remarkable life and career by saying, "Just when we despaired of finding a hero, she showed up, to give the sign of democracy....

From the inimitable Roy Blount, Jr., to the irrepressible Bruce Jay Friedman, the wry Calvin Trillin to the withering David Sedaris, a veritable who&#x2019;s who of contemporary and classic humorists examine all manner of human frailty through a slightly skewed lens. The fact that sometimes the humans are not of this earth or are, oh, say, deceased, bloodthirsty conquerors, matters not at all. Frazier&#x2019;s point is that there is humor to be found everywhere. Indeed, his own &#x201c;Lamentations of the Father,&#x201d; in which the rules of parenthood are laid down in the voice of the Almighty sets the standard for other laugh-inducing entries, such as Steve Martin&#x2019;s droll analysis of our new century in &#x201c;The Third Millennium: So Far, So Good,&#x201d; and Simon Rich&#x2019;s clever adults-versus-children, table-turning scenario in &#x201c;Play Nice.&#x201d; With an accessible balance of short slapstick and cerebral satire, Frazier&#x2019;s collection is good for more than a few laughs. --Carol Haggas</p><h2>Quilt Trip: A Southern Quilting Mystery</h2><p><i>As a quilter, retired folk art curator Beatrice Coleman likes to have all the seams stitched together&#x2014;but her plans keep getting tangled up in unexpected ways...</i><br><br>Beatrice has never crashed a party but now her fellow quilt guild member, Meadow Downey, is driving them to a Victorian mansion in the mountains beyond Dappled Hills, North Carolina.

Shapland recognizes herself in the letters&#x2019; language&#x2015;but does not see Carson as history has portrayed her.</p><p>And so, Shapland is compelled to undertake a recovery of the full narrative and language of Carson's life: She wades through the therapy transcripts; she stays at Carson&#x2019;s childhood home, where she lounges in her bathtub and eats delivery pizza; she relives Carson&#x2019;s days at her beloved Yaddo. As Shapland reckons with the expanding and collapsing distance between her and Carson, she see the way Carson&#x2019;s story has become a way to articulate something about herself. The results articulate something entirely new not only about this one remarkable, walleyed life, but about the way we tell queer love stories.In genre-defying vignettes, Jenn Shapland interweaves her own story with Carson McCullers&#x2019;s to create a vital new portrait of one of America&#x2019;s most beloved writers, and shows us how the writers we love and the stories we tell about ourselves make us who we are. &nbsp;</p><p>In genre-defying vignettes, Jenn Shapland interweaves her own story with Carson McCullers&#x2019;s to create a vital new portrait of one of America&#x2019;s most beloved writers, and shows us how the writers we love and the stories we tell about ourselves make us who we are. &nbsp;</p></p><p>Jenn Shapland's work won a 2017 Pushcart Prize and fellowships/residencies at Ucross, the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum, Yaddo, the Carson McCullers Center for Writers and Musicians, and Vermont Studio Center.

My favorite biographies are full of historical literary gossip and interested in the shadow selves of public persons. My favorite memoirs are those that scrutinize the self as an unreliable source of narrative truth and the one we must nonetheless rely upon.&nbsp;<em>The Autobiographies of Carson McCullers</em>&nbsp;manages to do all of this in earnest and honest and riveting vignettes.

Kwon, author of The Incendiaries</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Gorgeous, symphonic, tender, and brilliant, <em>My Autobiography of Carson McCullers</em> is a monumental achievement.

She spent ten years at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, where she won a Livingston Award and two Gerald Loeb awards. She lives in Brooklyn with her family.Hedging the risk of investing in commodities used to be the fairly dull province of a few brokers and traders on one side of a transaction and farmers and end users of crude oil, copper, and pork bellies on the other. But the great commodities boom of the early 2000s attracted flamboyant risk-takers, whose transactions ultimately produced wild swings in prices on gasoline, food, and other essentials and prompted regulators to try to crack down. CNBC market reporter Kelly (Street Fighters, 2009) unveils the secretive world of unregulated hedge funds, of banks and brokers who trade for their own accounts often against the interests of their customers. With exclusive access to the major players in the commodities market, Kelly offers fascinating portraits of huge egos and details of byzantine deals, including a massive merger aided by former UK prime minister Tony Blair. Among her subjects are a fuel trader whose trades saved a sagging Delta Air Lines and a trader at a Swiss commodities firm founded by American fugitive Marc Rich. This is an absorbing inside look at the shady world of multinational brokers. --Vanessa Bush</p><h2>The Chinese Gold Murders: A Judge Dee Detective Story (Judge Dee Mysteries)</h2><p><p>In this, the second book in Robert van Gulik's classic mystery series of ancient China, Judge Dee must look into the murder of his predecessor.

In this book, experienced portrait artist David Thomas shows that it need not be intimidating. Learn to use watercolour, pencil and charcoal to produce fresh and approachable portraits invested with life and character.</p><p>David Thomas R.I.B.A. is a well known artist whose award winning portrait paintings have appeared in Royal Portrait Society Open Exhibition (2016 and 2017).April 2016 In his new book Drawing &amp; Painting Portraits in Watercolour, David Thomas takes the mystery out of the subject and shows that portraits don't have to be intimidating. Wityh chapters on the materials you need, composing your work, lighting and backgrounds. David establishes the basics in an easy-to-follow style. Sections on drawing and watercolour techniques drawing from life and photographs, move you forward so that you are ready to get along with the five set projects - two in charcoal and three in watercolour. David's appraoch is lively and accessible. * The Leisure Painter * If I were to describe this book in one word, it would be fantastic. I love all of it. Portrait painting requires great skill and insight. At some point all artists have a dab at portraits, but it is not easy to master portraying character and quirks of a personality. This book shows you how to paint portraits using different mediums - watercolour, pencil and charcoal. It shows clearly how to build your sketches and how to capture character in your artwork. More than that it teaches proportion, backgrounds, pose and much more. There are five step-by-step portrait demonstrations. You'll also find useful information on design, composition and lighting. Special attention is paid to eyes, hands and hair. The front cover says it all really and this book should improve your technique immensely. The book is amply illustrated with David's admirable work. He shows many individual and group portraits. I am also fascinated by David's own easel design - highly innovative and useful. I am surprised the publisher did not make this a hardback book, it is an absolute classic. If I wanted to master portraiture, I would ask David to teach me. This book is a fine manual of portrait painting. Fabulous. Highly recommended, in fact I cannot recommend it highly enough. It's without doubt the best painting book I have seen for some time. * Karen Platt- yarnsandfabrics.co.uk * This book is methodically laid out, gently leading you up to portraiture through detailed explanations of tools, materials, choosing a picture and the basic principles needed for a good portrait; all accompanied with beautiful and detailed pictures. The 'drawing' part of the book is small, if you are looking to become competent at drawing then this isn't the right book, it feels more like practicing size, shape, proportion and tone in preparation for painting than learning to draw however it's fundamental to practice, and become competent at the drawing stage, before attempting watercolour (I need to vastly improve before I can paint). It is suggested to use a 6B pencil for drawing but I found it too heavy/dark and will likely use others as well. The painting section is the largest portion of the book; starting with basic and intermediate techniques, a compact and informative piece on the use of colour followed by info on painting from both life and photos and lastly details that require special attention i.e. hair, eyes. Lastly we have 3 heavily detailed watercolour step by steps, with lots of accompanying pictures, to practice the info detailed in the book. I like that you are told specific sizes of brush and where and how to use them, this makes painting (for the beginner/novice) that little bit easier. This book is very well written, concise and the pictures are both beautiful and a great visual aid, I found it much more engaging than previous watercolour books I have read and the exercises by far the most detailed. This isn't a book for someone wanting to just pick up and have a go but for people who are willing to put in the work to become competent watercolour artists. I look forward to learning how to paint portraits once I have become more competent at drawing. * Charlotte Blakely * This is quite the best book on portrait painting, in any medium, that I've seen for a very long time, perhaps ever. I'm drawn to a comparison with Capturing Personality in Pastel by Dennis Frost, which appeared in the late 1970's. The main similarity, it seems to me, is that this is more about getting the character of your subject than of preserving a detailed likeness, which is perhaps the prerogative of oils or acrylics. Watercolour is a more fluid medium and its washes, tints and hues are perhaps best suited to this more relaxed, looser approach. There is certainly great subtlety here. As an instructional book, this is maybe not one for the complete beginner. There are very few simple exercises and David assumes a fair degree of familiarity with your materials and the techniques and properties associated with the medium. Although there are demonstrations, they are there more to show how the work was built up than to be followed literally, I feel. I would also question how useful it is to work on a subject you've never met, though you might find it worth practising with some of them just to see whether you can achieve the result aimed for. However, as a book for someone who's had a bit of experience and wants to progress further, particularly in relation to capturing character, this is totally worthwhile. It's thorough and goes into a lot of detail, with plenty of examples and explanations that will keep you happy for a very long time. Even if you were to conclude that your work will never be as good as David's, it can't help but be a very great deal better than when you started. * Artbookreview.net * While there is `a great tradition of outstanding watercolour painters', David Thomas notes a scarcity of watercolour paintings in portrait exhibitions, despite the medium's `inherent ability to capture subtle tonal variations' (thus making it ideal for faces). His book seeks to address the dominance of opaque media in portraiture by encouraging the reader to paint portraits in watercolour. David starts with general watercolour advice - materials (paint colours, brushes and papers) and techniques (washes, wet in wet, dropping in, lifting out, granulation etc). He also includes drawing materials - graphite pencils and charcoal, plus techniques - I was particularly interested to see a white charcoal pencil employed to give subtle, but very effective, highlights to a sitter's beard! Topics such as design, composition, cropping, colour, tone, lighting and backgrounds are all covered, making this an extremely comprehensive book on drawing and painting in general too. I found the section on proportions of the face and body particularly clearly presented. Finally there are articles on eyes, hair and hands. Examples are drawn and painted from life as well as photographs. The step by step demonstrations are very comprehensive (35 - 54 steps each) and include the names of all the colours used, when and how to mix them and brush size and use. They are also an ideal opportunity to see the watercolour techniques in practice (lifting out, a background wash while the portrait is turned sideways etc). I found the last portrait in the book to be the most accomplished and endearing, `Waiting for the Telegram' (Katherine). This sublime painting definitely deserves to be on the cover and would be reason enough to take up the Portraits in Watercolour challenge! David succeeds in `selling' the medium to me as a choice for portraiture. Before seeing this book, I probably wouldn't have considered the combination before. Whether I could be permanently tempted away from oils and acrylics remains to be seen - the only way to know for sure is to give it a go.... * Andrea Hook * This is one of the most comprehensive guides to painting poeple there has been in a very long time. Although a reasonable degree of technical ability is assumed, David does not ignore the basics such as pose proportion and composition. He includes male and female figures,full of half-face poses, young and old sitters and groups as well as single subjects. It is hard to spot anything that has been omitted. As well as the introductory notes, there are plenty of demonstrations andf technical tips that are introduced progressively. Instructions that are longer than is sometimes the case in instructional books, explaining what is happening at every stage. The whole thing is so gentle it's so easy to forget you're learning. David's style is quite loosed, providing an impression rahter than warts and all detail, allowing for a good deal of interpretation while preserving facial structure and likeness. The book is thoroughly recommended. * The Artist *</p><h2>The Tenderness of Wolves: A Novel</h2><p><i>A brilliant and breathtaking debut that captivated readers and garnered critical acclaim in the United Kingdom,</i> The Tenderness of Wolves <i>was long-listed for the Orange Prize in fiction and won the Costa Award (formerly the Whitbread) Book of the Year.</i> <br><br> The year is 1867. Winter has just tightened its grip on Dove River, a tiny isolated settlement in the Northern Territory, when a man is brutally murdered. Laurent Jammett had been a voyageur for the Hudson Bay Company before an accident lamed him four years earlier. The same accident afforded him the little parcel of land in Dove River, land that the locals called unlucky due to the untimely death of the previous owner. <br> <br> A local woman, Mrs. Ross, stumbles upon the crime scene and sees the tracks leading from the dead man's cabin north toward the forest and the tundra beyond. It is Mrs. Ross's knock on the door of the largest house in Caulfield that launches the investigation. Within hours she will regret that knock with a mother's love -- for soon she makes another discovery: her seventeen-year-old son Francis has disappeared and is now considered a prime suspect. <br> <br> In the wake of such violence, people are drawn to the crime and to the township -- Andrew Knox, Dove River's elder statesman; Thomas Sturrock, a wily American itinerant trader; Donald Moody, the clumsy young Company representative; William Parker, a half-breed Native American and trapper who was briefly detained for Jammett's murder before becoming Mrs. Ross's guide. But the question remains: do these men want to solve the crime or exploit it? <br> <br> One by one, the searchers set out from Dove River following the tracks across a desolate landscape -- home to only wild animals, madmen, and fugitives -- variously seeking a murderer, a son, two sisters missing for seventeen years, and a forgotten Native American culture before the snows settle and cover the tracks of the past for good. <br> <br> In an astonishingly assured debut, Stef Penney deftly weaves adventure, suspense, revelation, and humor into an exhilarating thriller; a panoramic historical romance; a gripping murder mystery; and, ultimately, with the sheer scope and quality of her storytelling, an epic for the ages.</p><p><b>Stef Penney</b> was born and grew up in Edinburgh. After earning a degree in philosophy and theology from Bristol University, she turned to filmmaking, studying film and TV at Bournemouth College of Art. On graduation she was selected for the Carlton Television New Writers Scheme. She is a screenwriter. <i>The Tenderness of Wolves</i> is her first novel.The last time I saw Laurent Jammet, he was in Scott's store with a dead wolf over his shoulder. I had gone to get needles, and he had come in for the bounty. Scott insisted on the whole carcass, having once been bamboozled by a Yankee who brought in a pair of ears one day and claimed his bounty, then some time later brought in the paws for another dollar, and finally the tail. It was winter and the parts looked fairly fresh, but the con became common knowledge, to Scott's disgust. So the wolf's face was the first thing I saw when I walked in. The tongue lolled out of the mouth, which was pulled back in a grimace. I flinched, despite myself. Scott yelled and Jammet apologized profusely; it was impossible to be angry with him, what with his charm and his limp. The carcass was removed out back somewhere, and as I was browsing, they began to argue about the moth-eaten pelt that hangs over the door. I think Jammet suggested jokingly that Scott replace it with a new one. The sign under it reads, "Canis lupus (male), the first wolf to be caught in the town of Caulfield, 11th February, 1860." The sign tells you a lot about John Scott, demonstrating his pretensions to learning, his self-importance, and the craven respect for authority over truth. It certainly wasn't the first wolf to be caught around here, and there is no such thing as the town of Caulfield, strictly speaking, although he would like there to be, because then there would be a council, and he could be its mayor.<p>"Anyway, that is a female. Males have a darker collar, and are bigger. This one is very small."</p><p>Jammet knew what he was talking about, as he had caught more wolves than anyone else I know. He smiled, to show he meant no offense, but Scott takes offense like it is going out of fashion, and bristled.</p><p>"I suppose you remember better than I do, Mr. Jammet?"</p><p>Jammet shrugged. Since he wasn't here in 1860, and since he was French, unlike the rest of us, he had to watch his step.</p><p>At this point I stepped up to the counter. "I think it was a female, Mr. Scott. The man who brought it in said her cubs howled all night. I remember it distinctly."</p><p>And the way Scott strung up the carcass by its back legs outside the store for everyone to gawp at. I had never seen a wolf before, and I was surprised at its smallness. It hung with its nose pointing at the ground, eyes closed as if ashamed. Men mocked the carcass, and children laughed, daring each other to put their hands in its mouth. They posed with it for each other's amusement.</p><p>Scott turned tiny, bright blue eyes on me, either affronted that I should side with a foreigner, or just affronted, it was hard to tell.</p><p>"And look what happened to him." Doc Wade, the man who brought in the bounty, drowned the following spring -- as though that threw his judgment into question.</p><p>"Ah, well..." Jammet shrugged and winked at me, the cheek.</p><p>Somehow -- I think Scott mentioned it first -- we got talking about those poor girls, as people usually do when the subject of wolves is raised. Although there are any number of unfortunate females in the world (plenty in my experience alone), around here "those poor girls" always refers to only two -- the Seton sisters, who vanished all those years ago. There were a few minutes' pleasant and pointless exchange of views that broke off suddenly when the bell rang and Mrs. Knox came in. We pretended to be very interested in the buttons on the counter. Laurent Jammet took his dollar, bowed to me and Mrs. Knox, and left. The bell jangled on its metal spring for a long time after he walked out.</p><p>That was all, nothing significant about it. The last time I saw him.</p><p>Laurent Jammet was our closest neighbor. Despite this, his life was a mystery to us. I used to wonder how he hunted wolves with his bad leg, and then someone told me that he baited deer meat with strychnine. The skill came in following the trail to the resulting corpse. I don't know, though; that is not hunting as I see it. I know wolves have learned to stay out of range of a Winchester rifle, so they cannot be entirely stupid, but they are not so clever that they have learned to distrust a free gift of food, and where is the merit in following a doomed creature to its end? There were other unusual things about him: long trips away from home in parts unknown; visits from dark, taciturn strangers; and brief displays of startling generosity, in sharp counterpoint to his dilapidated cabin. We knew that he was from Quebec. We knew that he was Catholic, although he did not often go to church or to confession (though he may have indulged in both during his long absences). He was polite and cheerful, although he did not have particular friends, and kept a certain distance. And he was, I daresay, handsome, with almost-black hair and eyes, and features that gave the impression of having just finished smiling, or being just about to start. He treated all women with the same respectful charm, but managed not to irritate either them or their husbands. He was not married and showed no inclination to do so, but I have noticed that some men are happier on their own, especially if they are rather slovenly and irregular in their habits.</p><p>Some people attract an idle and entirely unmalicious envy. Jammet was one of those, lazy and good-natured, who seem to slide through life without toil or effort. I thought him lucky, because he did not seem to worry about those things that turn the rest of us gray. He had no gray hairs, but he had a past, which he kept mostly to himself. He imagined himself to have a future, too, I suppose, but he did not. He was perhaps forty. It was as old as he would ever get.</p><p>It is a Thursday morning in mid-November, about two weeks after that meeting in the store. I walk down the road from our house in a dreadful temper, planning my lecture carefully. More than likely I rehearse it aloud -- one of many strange habits that are all too easy to pick up in the backwoods. The road -- actually little more than a series of ruts worn by hooves and wheels -- follows the river where it plunges down a series of shallow falls. Under the birches patches of moss gleam emerald in the sunlight. Fallen leaves, crystallized by the night's frost, crackle under my feet, whispering of the coming winter. The sky is an achingly clear blue. I walk quickly in my anger, head high. It probably makes me look cheerful.</p><p>Jammet's cabin sits away from the riverbank in a patch of weeds that passes for a garden. The unpeeled log walls have faded over the years until the whole thing looks gray and woolly, more like a living growth than a building. It is something from a bygone age: the door is buckskin stretched over a wooden frame, the windows glazed with oiled parchment. In winter he must freeze. It's not a place where the women of Dove River often call, and I haven't been here myself for months, but right now I have run out of places to look.</p><p>There is no smoke signal of life inside, but the door stands ajar; the buckskin stained from earthy hands. I call out, then knock on the wall. There is no reply, so I peer inside, and when my eyes have adjusted to the dimness I see Jammet, at home and, true to form, asleep on his bed at this time in the morning. I nearly walk away then, thinking there is no point waking him, but frustration makes me persevere. I haven't come all this way for nothing.</p><p>"Mr. Jammet?" I start off, sounding, to my mind, irritatingly bright. "Mr. Jammet, I am sorry to disturb you, but I must ask..."</p><p>Laurent Jammet sleeps peacefully. Around his neck is the red neckerchief he wears for hunting, so that other hunters will not mistake him for a bear and shoot him. One foot protrudes off the side of the bed, in a dirty sock. His red neckerchief is on the table...I have grasped the side of the door. Suddenly, from being normal, everything has changed completely: flies hover around their late autumn feast; the red neckerchief is not around his neck, it cannot be, because it is on the table, and that means...</p><p>"Oh," I say, and the sound shocks me in the silent cabin. "No."</p><p>I cling on to the door, trying not to run away, although I realize a second later I couldn't move if my life depended on it.</p><p>The redness around his neck has leaked into the mattress from a gash. A gash. I'm panting, as though I've been running. The door frame is the most important thing in the world right now. Without it, I don't know what I would do.</p><p>The neckerchief has not done its duty. It has failed to prevent his untimely death.</p><p>I don't pretend to be particularly brave, and, in fact, long ago gave up the notion that I have any remarkable qualities, but I am surprised at the calmness with which I look around the cabin. My first thought is that Jammet has destroyed himself, but Jammet's hands are empty, and there is no sign of a weapon near him. One hand dangles off the side of the bed. It does not occur to me to be afraid. I know with absolute certainty that whoever did this is nowhere near -- the cabin proclaims its emptiness. Even the body on the bed is empty. There are no attributes to it now -- the cheerfulness and slovenliness and skill at shooting, the generosity and callousness -- they have all gone.</p><p>There is one other thing I can't help but notice, as his face is turned slightly away from me. I don't want to see it, but it's there, and it confirms what I have already unwillingly accepted -- that among all the things in the world that can never be known, Laurent Jammet's fate is not one of them. This is no accident, nor is it self-destruction. He has been scalped.</p><p>At length, although it is probably only a few seconds later, I pull the door closed behind me, and when I can't see him anymore, I feel better. Although for the rest of that day, and for days after, my right hand aches from the violence with which I gripped the door frame, as though I had been trying to knead the wood between my fingers, like dough.Copyright � 2006 by Stef Penney</p></p><h2>The Murderers (Badge of Honor, No. 6)</h2><p>A Philadelphia narcotics cop is shot dead in his home.

Our land needs to be awakened to the futility of seeking happiness without God.<br>- Clear when interpreted in the light of its overall theme.<br>- Suitable not merely for 'the light-hearted and thoughtless' but for 'the most eminent saint of God'.<br>- Necessary. 'On no account could we have spared this book from the canon. It has its own sphere of instruction and that of no common value'.<br>- Harmonious with the New Testament. 'We cannot fully enforce and apply Ecclesiastes except by the aid of Gospel light'.<br>- Sanctifying. The message of the book is designed to bring men to complete consecration to God, as Bridges declares: 'The men that we want are lively, warm, real men- men who have a daily contact with a personal living Saviour- men whose religion is the element in which they breathe, the principle by which they work- men who think of life as the seed time for eternity'.</p><p>Charles Bridges (1794-1869) was one of the leaders of the Evangelical party in the Church of England in the nineteenth century. He was the vicar of Old Newton, Suffolk, from 1823 to 1849, and later of Weymouth and Hinton Martell in Dorset.<br><br>Educated at Queen's College, Cambridge, Bridges was ordained in 1817. As a preacher he was called upon for such important occasions as the Clerical Conference at Weston-super-Mare in 1858 (when he preached along with J. C. Ryle) and the consecration of the Bishop of Carlisle in York Minster in l860.<br><br>Renowned though he was in his own day for his pulpit ministry, his subsequent fame rests in the books which came from his pen <i>An Exposition of Psalm CXIX</i> (1827), <i>Forty-eight Scriptural Studies</i> (5th ed. 1833), <i>Fifty-four Scriptural Studies (1837), <i>An Exposition of the Book of Proverbs</i> (1846), <i>a Manual for the Young</i> (1849), and <i>An Exposition of the Book of Ecclesiastes</i> (1860). His <i>The Christian Ministry</i> went through nine editions within 20 years of its appearance in 1829 and has probably remained unequalled in its field. These works earned high commendation from many, including C. H. Spurgeon, who described all Bridge's writings as 'very suggestive to ministers.'<br><br>After his death a small selection of his correspondence was published in book form in 1870 and it reveals a man of deep Christian piety. 'I never remember anyone,' says the writer of the Foreword to The Christian Ministry, 'in whose presence it was more difficult to be irreligious, or even frivolous.'</i></p><h2>Performance Management 2/E (Briefcase Books Series)</h2><p><p><b>Proven strategies for maximizing employee commitment and performance</b></p> <p>As a manager, you know that employee performance is your most important asset&#x2015;but are you making smart, well-thought-out efforts to leverage it to its fullest?</p> <p><i>Manager&#x2019;s Guide to Performance Management</i> helps you get the most out of your people by focusing on performance planning (instead of appraising), creating a dialog (instead of issuing directives), and solving problems (instead of pointing blame).

For over seven hours, the Allied force attempted to attack the Japanese invasion force, finally breaking off in the early evening. Some three hours later, the Allied force, now reduced to just four remaining cruisers and two destroyers, attempted another attack on the invasion convoy during which Japanese torpedoes scored heavily, sinking two Dutch cruisers and bringing the battle to a conclusion. Over the next two days, as the Allies attempted to flee, five more ships were sunk. From that point on, Allied naval power was eliminated from Southeast Asia. </p><p>In this illustrated title, Mark Stille tells the full story of the battle of the Java Sea, explaining how and why the Japanese achieved such a resounding victory, and delving into the tremendous impact of the battle on the course of the Pacific War.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark E.

If he takes the red pill, he will find out what the &#x201c;matrix&#x201d; really is, and many of his earlier beliefs will be shattered. When it comes to taking a hard look at a specific set of beliefs about parenthood and reproduction that has driven our society for generations, The Baby Matrix is the red pill.We commonly think our desire to have children boils down to our biological wiring, but author Laura Carroll says it's much more than that. Unlike other books on parenthood, The Baby Matrix: Why Freeing Our Minds From Outmoded Thinking About Parenthood &amp; Reproduction Will Create a Better World takes a serious look at powerful social and cultural influences that drive the desire for the parenthood experience, and lays out why we need to be very aware of these influences to make the most informed decisions about parenthood.The Baby Matrix looks at long-held beliefs about parenthood and reproduction, and unravels why we believe what we believe. It lays out: -the historical origins of beliefs about parenthood and reproduction-why many of these beliefs no longer work for society or were never true in the first place-why we continue to believe them anyway-the prices society pays as a result The Baby Matrix shows us how we got here, brings to light what is true, which includes knowing about the powerful influence of &#x201c;pronatalism,&#x201d; and explains why society can no longer afford to leave pronatalism unquestioned. &#x201c;This is not a book about convincing people not to have children,&#x201d; says Carroll. &#x201c;I want people to be very aware of the long-held social and cultural pressures, and be able to free themselves from those pressures when making parenthood choices. This will result in more people making the best decisions for themselves, will foster a society in which those who are best suited to become parents are the ones who have children and one that knows what it means to bring a child into the world today.&#x201d;This book will make you examine your own intentions and beliefs, will rile you, and might just change your mind. Whether you are already a parent, want to become a parent, are still making up your mind, or know you don&#x2019;t want children, you&#x2019;ll never think about parenthood in the same way. The Baby Matrix is a must-read for anyone interested in psychology, sociology, anthropology, parenting issues, environmentalism, and social justice. But most of all, it&#x2019;s for anyone, parent or not, who reveres the truth and wants the best for themselves, their families, and our world.</p><p>In addition to <i>The Baby Matrix</i>, Laura Carroll's books include <i>Families of Two: Interviews with HappilyMarried Couples Without Children by Choice,</i> <i>Man Swarm: How Overpopulation is Killing the Wild World (</i>co-author),&nbsp;<i>Voluntary and Involuntary Childlessness: TheJoys of Otherhood? </i>(contributor), and <i>FindingFulfillment From the Inside Out.</i>&nbsp;<br>Laura's books have been used in college curriculum, she is an internationally recognized expert on the childfree choice, and since the year 2000, Laura has been featured&nbsp;on network television, including ABC's Good Morning America and CBS' The Early Show, and has been a guest on a variety of radio talk shows, US and Canadian public radio.

Carroll details seven assumptions that make up this ongoing pronatal bias and summarizes relevant research from the last twenty years thereby effectively drawing the reader in to actually 'think'about each assumption.&nbsp;<br><br>Describing seven post-pronatal assumptions she then brings the reader toward seeing a society in which every adult would have the psychological freedom to find her/his way to creating a fulfilling adult identity that would not by necessity include parenthood.

Carroll explores the myths and pressures behind pronatalism -- the pervasive idea that everyone should have children -- to make the argument that we'd all be better off if having kids were considered not an inevitability or a duty, but a vocation best suited for those who consider it a true calling. She debunks multiple misconceptions driving pronatalist attitudes, like the "biological clock" and the assumption that having children is the greatest source of human meaning and fulfillment.Reading&nbsp;<i>The Baby Matrix</i>&nbsp;as an infertile woman helped me distinguish what parts of my grief were from actually wanting to be a parent,and what parts were driven by social expectations and stigma around childlessness. And being able to define *why* I wanted children was ultimately empowering during a time I felt most helpless." ~Alexandra Kimball, BuzzFeed Contributor<br><br>Carroll's book is also for <i>all</i> of us,whether we are parents or not.

Long out of print and never before available in paperback, it has been newly revised. This expanded and updated edition marks a major publishing event.<br><br> Arianism has been called the "archetypal Christian heresy" because it denies the divinity of Christ. In his masterly examination of Arianism, Rowan Williams argues that Arius himself was actually a dedicated theological conservative whose concern was to defend the free and personal character of the Christian God. His "heresy" grew out of an attempt to unite traditional biblical language with radical philosophical ideas and techniques and was, from the start, involved with issues of authority in the church. Thus, the crisis of the early fourth century was not only about the doctrine of God but also about the relations between emperors, bishops, and "charismatic" teachers in the church's decision-making. In the course of his discussion, Williams raises the vital wider questions of how heresy is defined and how certain kinds of traditionalism transform themselves into heresy.<br><br> Augmented with a new appendix in which Williams interacts with significant scholarship since 1987, this book provides fascinating reading for anyone interested in church history and the development of Christian doctrine.</p><p>Rowan Williams served as the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012 and is now Master of Magdalene College, University of Cambridge. A Fellow of the British Academy and an internationally recognized theologian, he was previously Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford, Bishop of Monmouth, and Archbishop of Wales.</p><h2>Iamblichus on the Mysteries of the Egyptians, Chaldeans, and Assyrians: The Complete Text</h2><p><p><strong>The Syrian philosopher Iamblichus is famous for his accounts of ancient religious traditions: this book contains Thomas Taylor&#x2019;s translations of his commentaries regarding Egypt, Assyria and Chaldea.</strong></p><p>Containing many references to the mystical philosophies of the ancients, Iamblichus&#x2019; writings are considered early accounts of theurgic traditions for their description of magical rituals and ceremonies. His descriptions hold clues to the origins and development of religious thought - particularly pagan ideas regarding burial, the afterlife, and the transition of the soul from matter to spirit.</p><p>Taylor is keen to replicate the veneration and respect which Iamblichus had for earlier traditions: both author and translator share a devotion to Neoplatonist thought, and it is in the spirit of these philosophical ideas that these insights upon antiquity are presented in English.</p><p>This edition of Iamblichus&#x2019;s works includes Taylor&#x2019;s numerous annotations.

In the wake of Copernican theory and discoveries through the telescope, the notion of an ordered cosmos of "fixed stars" gave way to that of a universe infinite in both time and space-with significant and far-reaching consequences for human thought. Alexandre Koyr� brilliantly interprets this revolution in terms of the change that occurred in our conception of the universe and our place in it, and illustrates the primacy of this change in the development of the modern world.<p> "An important contribution to the problem of the transition from the world view characteristic of the medieval centuries to that which rapidly gained acceptance after the seventeenth century."

While Sefton has worked as both a CPA and a real estate broker, she feels that neither of those endeavors compare to the challenge of creating worlds on paper. She is the mother of four grown daughters, currently scattered around the globe, and resides in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado with two very demanding dogs.Sefton's seventh puzzler to feature Kelly Flynn, crafty sleuth of Fort Connor, Colo., and the House of Lambspun knitters (after 2008's <i>Fleece Navidad</i>) finds them worrying about their friend Jennifer Stroud, who's been raped. Though Jennifer initially refuses to report the attack to the authorities, she agrees to attend a weekend workshop for women who've suffered sexual violence. Kelly and physical therapist Lisa Gerrard are teaching a fiber class for the May retreat at Lazy C Ranch, whose owner, Cal Everett, turns out to be Jennifer's assailant. When Cal's found dead, pushed over the railing of a steep deck with Jennifer's latest afghan project draped over his body, Jennifer becomes a murder suspect. Sefton skillfully handles a sensitive topic while weaving in happier moments for her amateur detectives, such as the marriage of Mimi Shafer, Lambspun's owner, and Burt Parker, a retired Fort Connor detective. <i>(June)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Myers was one of the founders of the Society of Psychical Research and he spent much of his life researching the survival of consciousness, so it is not surprising that having passed away in 1901, if he found himself conscious of his surroundings, he would try to communicate with his colleagues and loved ones still in the flesh. According to a renowned automatic writing medium Geraldine Cummins, this happened in the 1920&#39;s. Communicating through Cummins, Myers stated: &#34;We communicate an impression through the inner mind of the medium. It receives the impression in a curious way. It has to contribute to the body of the message; we furnish the spirit of it. In other words, we send the thoughts and the words usually in which they must be framed, but the actual letters or spelling of the words is drawn from the medium&#39;s memory. Sometimes we only send the thoughts and the medium&#39;s unconscious mind clothes them in words.&#34; Discarnate messengers such as Silver Birch have spoken about the group-soul and Myers went into great detail about the subject. &#34;When I was on earth, I belonged to a group-soul, but its branches and the spirit - which might be compared to the roots - were in the invisible,&#34; &#34;Now, if you would understand psychic evolution, this group-soul must be studied and understood. For instance, it explains many of the difficulties that people will assure you can be removed only by the doctrine of reincarnation. You may think my statement frivolous, but the fact that we do appear on earth to be paying for the sins of another life is, in a certain sense, true. It is our life and yet not our life. In other words, a soul belonging to the group of which I am a part lived that previous life which built up for me the framework of my earthly life, lived it before I had passed through the gates of birth.&#34; Myers further explained that the group soul might contain twenty souls, a hundred, or a thousand. &#34;The number varies,&#34; he said. &#34;It is different for each man. But what the Buddhist would call the karma I had brought with me from a previous life is, very frequently, not that of my life, but of the life of a soul that preceded me by many years on earth and left for me the pattern which made my life. I, too, wove a pattern for another of my group during my earthly career. Myers added that the Buddhist&#39;s idea of rebirth, of man&#39;s continual return to earth, is but a half-truth. &#34;And often half a truth is more inaccurate than an entire misstatement. I shall not live again on earth, but a new soul, one who will join our group, will shortly enter into the pattern or karma I have woven for him on earth.&#34; Myers likened the soul to a spectator caught within the spell of some drama outside of its actual life, perceiving all the consequences of acts, moods, and thoughts of a kindred soul. He further pointed out that there are an infinite variety of conditions in the invisible world and that he made no claim to being infallible. He called it a &#34;general rule&#34; based on what he had learned and experienced on the Other Side.</p><p>Geraldine Cummins (January 24, 1890 - August 24, 1969) was an Irish automatic writing medium and author. Cummins automatic writing was mainly of a spiritual nature and was witnessed by several theologians and scholars who later endorsed and edited her writings. Her first book, The Spirits of Cleophas (1928), claimed to supplement the biblical books of the Acts of the Apostles and the epistles of St. Paul. It was a historic narrative of the early church and the work of the apostles from immediately after the death of Jesus to St. Paul&#39;s departure from Berea for Athens. In the production of the first two sections of the book, Cummins was associated with F. Bligh Bond, the noted English architect, illustrator, archaeologist, and psychical researcher, but later she received the scripts independently. Her second book, Paul in Athens (1930) is a continuation of &#39;Cleophas &#39;The third, The Great Days of Ephesus (1933), followed the same line of thought. The trilogy offered new interpretations of several obscure passages in the Acts of the Apostles, which apparently are more in line with the early church. For example, it was claimed that only a profound student could have given the head of the Jewish community in Antioch the title &#34;Archon,&#34; because the usual title was &#34;ethnarch.&#34; In the chronicle of Cleophas, Cleophas was not the direct communicator. The information came through an entity know as &#34;the messenger.&#34; The messenger was ostensibly lower down the spiritual food chain than Cleophas and therefore could communicate with Cummins on the earth plane. Cummins&#39;s fourth book, The Road to Immortality (1932), a series of communications allegedly from F. W. H. Myers, gives a glorious vision of the progression of the human spirit through eternity. In the Introduction Beatrice Gibbes described the method of communication employed by Cummins. She would sit at a table, cover her eyes with her left and hand on concentrate on &#34;stillness.&#34; She would then fall into a light trance or dream state. Her hand would then begin to write. Usually, her &#34;control&#34; would make some introductory remarks and announce that another entity was waiting to speak. Because of her semi-trance condition and also because of the speed at which the writing would come, Gibbes would sit beside her and remove each sheet of paper as it was filled. Cummins&#39; hand was quickly lifted by Gibbes to the top of the new page, and the writing would continue without a break. In one sitting, Gibbes stated, Cummins wrote 2,000 words in 75 minutes, whereas her normal compositions were much slower - perhaps 800 words in seven or eight hours. Gibbes added that she witnessed the writing of about 50 different personalities, all claiming to be &#39;dead,&#39; and all differing in character and style, coming through Cummins&#39; hand. The noted physicist and psychical researcher Sir Oliver Lodge offered his observations of Cummins&#39;s genuineness in the book&#39;s preface: &#34;I believe this to be a genuine attempt to convey approximately true ideas, through an amanuensis of reasonable education, characterized by ready willingness for devoted service, and of transparent honesty.&#34; Cummins went on to author The Swan on a Black Sea: a Study in Automatic Writing: the Cummins-Willett Scripts (1970). The book is a detailed study of her automatic scripts received from the deceased &#34;Mrs. Willett&#34; a pseudonym of Winifred Coombe-Tennant, the British suffragette, politician, and philanthropist.

Against her better judgment, herbalist and tea-shop owner China takes pity on Sally, who's just lost her home and suffers from split personality disorder, and offers her a place to stay. Soon enough, a stalker targeting Sally makes threatening calls to China, and the police suspect Sally of involvement in a murder. With Mike away on business, China again turns sleuth to determine what connection the stalker might have to the deaths of Sally's parents almost 10 years earlier&#x2014;and to prevent any harm to herself or her children. More than once China and her best friend, Ruby, dress up as Sesame Street characters to disarm suspicion. Series fans will enjoy catching up with old friends, though newcomers are likely to find the soap-operish family relationships of less interest. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But then a strange car pulled up to their street. One boy got into the car, two did not, and something terrible happened -- something that ended their friendship and changed all three boys forever.</p><p>Twenty-five years later, Sean is a homicide detective. Jimmy is an ex-con who owns a corner store. And Dave is trying to hold his marriage together and keep his demons at bay -- demons that urge him to do terrible things. When Jimmy's daughter is found murdered, Sean is assigned to the case. His investigation brings him into conflict with Jimmy, who finds his old criminal impulses tempt him to solve the crime with brutal justice. And then there is Dave, who came home the night Jimmy's daughter died covered in someone else's blood. </p><p>A tense and unnerving psychological thriller, <em>Mystic River</em> is also an epic novel of love and loyalty, faith and family, in which people irrevocably marked by the past find themselves on a collision course with the darkest truths of their own hidden selves.</p></p><p>Ever since blasting onto the literary scene with the Shamus Award-winning <i>A Drink Before the War</i>, Dennis Lehane has been the golden boy of noir. His Patrick Kenzie and Angela Gennaro novels are marvels of tight pacing, dialogue so good it gets under your skin and stays there, with dead-on portrayals of working-class Boston neighborhoods. Sure, he's the oft-proclaimed, hard-boiled heir to Hammett and Chandler, but Lehane also takes a page from the Hemingway school of hyper-intense writing. He pares away and pares away until he's left with the absolute essentials--and then those essentials just explode off the page. <p> In his five Kenzie-Gennaro novels, the detective duo is at the nexus of Lehane's big bang. Darkly funny and just this side of jaded, Angie and Patrick move through Dorchester's bleak streets with an assurance born of familiarity. It's impossible to imagine these streets without the pair, or to imagine the pair away from those streets. <i>Mystic River</i>, then, arrives as a bit of a gamble, as Lehane moves from the sharp edges of portraiture to the broader strokes of landscape. No Angie, no Patrick: this neighborhood is on its own. It's not any prettier and certainly no friendlier, and its working-class fa�ade still barely masks the irresistible tug of violent ways, means, and ends. </p><p> Twenty-five years ago, Dave Boyle got into a car. When he came back four days later, he was different in a way that destroyed his friendship with Sean Devine and Jimmy Marcus. Now Sean's a cop, Jimmy's a store owner with a prison record and mob connections, and Dave's trying hard to keep his demons safely submerged. When Jimmy's daughter Katie is found murdered, each of the men must confront a past that none is eager to acknowledge. Lehane tugs delicately on the strands that weave this neighborhood together, testing for their strengths and weaknesses; this novel seems as much anthropological case study as thriller.</p><p> By turns violent and pensive, <i>Mystic River</i> is vintage Lehane. How good is it? You may go in missing Angie and Patrick, but after a few pages you won't even realize they're gone. Lehane's noir is still black magic. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>11 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>MoMA Make Art Mistakes: An Inspired Sketchbook for Everyone (MoMA Kids)</h2><p>With eye-catching interiors and playful activities, this open-ended sketchbook encourages would-be artists of all ages to look at the world around them and take chances expressing what they see.

The chronicler-theologian thus composed his work not just as a history of his people from their ancient beginnings but as an interpreted history, one designed to offer hope to the beleaguered community as well as to issue warnings that should they fall back into the ways of their fathers they could expect the judgment of God to be repeated.</p><p>Eugene Merrill's work on 1 and 2 Chronicles promises to be a significant contribution to the academic dialogue on these important books.

Merrill is distinguished professor emeritus of Old Testament studies at Dallas Theological Seminary in Dallas, Texas.

The crime rate's down and the stock market's up. Gentrification's prettying-up the old neighborhood. The New York streets don't look so mean anymore.</p><p>Then all hell breaks loose.</p><p>Scudder quickly discovers the spruced-up sidewalks are as mean as ever, dark and gritty and stained with blood. He's living in a world where the past is a minefield, the present is a war zone, and the future's an open question. It's a world where nothing is certain and nobody's safe, a random universe where no one's survival can be taken for granted. Not even his own.</p><p>A world where everybody dies.</p></p><p>You would think that by the 14th novel in a series, an author might become a bit bored with his characters, a bit sloppy in his writing. Thankfully, Lawrence Block is no such writer. Matt Scudder, in his 14th appearance, is as sharp and entertaining as he is in such mysteries as <i>Eight Million Ways to Die</i> and <i>A Dance at the Slaughterhouse</i>. Scudder is one of the few dicks out there with a fully fleshed-out personality; he's not insensitive to the mayhem around him, and his fears are well founded and realistic. After all, as the title boldly states, we live in a world where everybody dies.<p> Settled into married life, sober, and finally a legit private eye (the state granted his license), Scudder is prepared to become a respectable high-priced detective working for New York City lawyers. But when his old buddy, Mick Ballou, comes to him because two of his runners end up murdered, Scudder finds himself sinking back into the muck of the underworld. While dodging thugs who are out to put a stop to his investigation, Scudder must figure out who has it in for Ballou.</p><p> The writing in this novel is elegant--equally supple in describing the gibbous moon as it is in sorting out Scudder's feelings on the murder of a close friend, or when recounting a rather gory eye plucking. The dialogue is snappy and true to life. Lawrence Block once again proves he's worthy of the title Grand Master of Mystery. So be sure to set aside a chunk of time before you sit down to read this novel, because you're not going to be able to tear yourself away. <i>--Jenny Brown</i></p><p>Lawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery genre. He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America and is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus Awards, as well as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the Diamond Dagger from the British Crime Writers' Association&#x2014;only the third American to be given this award. He is a prolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short stories, and is a devoted New Yorker and an enthusiastic global traveler.</p></p><h2>Everyday Angels: How to Encounter, Experience, and Engage Angels in Everyday Life</h2><p><b>You can partner with&nbsp;Heaven's angelic hosts!</b><b><br>Do you have guardian angels?

This brief episode segues into one of Hal Foster's patented epics, "The Long Voyage to Thule," which ran for seven straight months and featured Valiant's return to his birthplace and reunion with his father. Of course, Foster's astonishingly detailed and evocative depictions of Val's homeland contribute greatly to this sprawling epic. After a series of shorter adventures including "The Seductress," "The Call of the Sea," and "The Jealous Cripple," Val finally decides he can stand it no more and sets out to find his long-lost love.

In the wake of the American Revolution, slavery gradually disappeared from the northern states and the importation of captive Africans was prohibited. Yet, at the same time, the country's slave population grew, new plantation crops appeared, and several new slave states joined the Union. Adam Rothman explores how slavery flourished in a new nation dedicated to the principle of equality among free men, and reveals the enormous consequences of U.S. expansion into the region that became the Deep South. </p><p>Rothman maps the combination of transatlantic capitalism and American nationalism that provoked a massive forced migration of slaves into Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. He tells the fascinating story of collaboration and conflict among the diverse European, African, and indigenous peoples who inhabited the Deep South during the Jeffersonian era, and who turned the region into the most dynamic slave system of the Atlantic world. Paying close attention to dramatic episodes of resistance, rebellion, and war, Rothman exposes the terrible violence that haunted the Jeffersonian vision of republican expansion across the American continent. </p><p><i>Slave Country</i> combines political, economic, military, and social history in an elegant narrative that illuminates the perilous relation between freedom and slavery in the early United States. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in an honest look at America's troubled past.</p></p><p>Adam Rothman is Associate Professor of History, Georgetown University.http://www.hup.harvard.edu/pdf/ROTSLA_excerpt.pdf</p><h2>Tracing Your Welsh Ancestors: A Guide for Family Historians (Tracing your Ancestors)</h2><p>Few previous publications have focused on Welsh family history, and none have provided a comprehensive guide to the genealogical information available and where to find it.

In this practical day-by-day guide to revising your manuscript, you will: * End procrastination by breaking your work down into manageable tasks * Learn the technical skills necessary to bring your prose to life * Discover how to write compelling dialogue * Solve narrative problems of structure, point of view and pacing * Learn how to sell and market your book once it is completed The material in this book was developed at L.A. Writers&#39; Lab over four and a half-years to help writers who were getting bogged down by the myriad vagaries of the rewrite process. By setting goals and having clearly defined guideposts this process has helped many writers complete their work in a timely manner. As the rewrite process involves moving between the left and right brain, this workbook is structured to approximate that experience. The first section, Preparation, contains an overview of the process and an in-depth discussion of story structure. It is followed by a series of left-brain Technical Matters. The second section is the 90-Day Rewrite workshop, which is divided into thirteen weeks, with each week addressing a key stage in the hero&#39;s journey. The weekly summaries provide an overview of the work to be covered that week, while the daily letters are focused on various aspects of the process and offer a single daily directive. The third section discusses what to do with your manuscript once you have completed your rewrite.</p><p>Bestselling author, Alan Watt, is a novelist and screenwriter, as well as one of the country's most trusted and respected writing instructors.

Embittered by his continuing poverty and by a serious illness, he undergoes a dramatic cure and becomes converted to a Protestant revivalist sect.

To many it brings to mind a past in which western culture was identified with the gospel in missionary practice and programs. Distressed with this history and uncertain about how to overcome it, many prefer to ignore the New Testament mandate that the church must be in mission if it is to be the church. Others swing the other way, declaring that everything the church does is mission, depriving the idea of mission of its power to define those specific actions of God which proclaim the gospel and build God's kingdom.<br> <br> "The church exists by missions, just as fire exists by burning." With these words of Emil Brunner, the author reminds us that to be the church is to be in mission. After describing the various "captivities of mission" which plague North American Christianity, the author argues for a robust and engaged practice of mission, beginning in congregations and extending to the broader community.</p><p><strong>Carlos F.

With the help of an editorial board, Marcus and Sollors settled on 216 artworks (film and painting as well as texts), authors, movements, and cultural artifacts that help answer the question, "What is America?" Emerson, Melville, Dickinson, and Faulkner are in there, to be sure, but so are the Winchester rifle, "Steamboat Willie," Chuck Berry's "Roll Over Beethoven," Alcoholics Anonymous, and Linda Lovelace (the star of the pornographic film "Deep Throat," who later said she'd been raped during its filming)...It will be a welcome change if a "literary history," for once, stirs up a little dust.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Christopher Shea</b><b>, </b><b><i>Boston Globe Brainiac blog</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;[An] essential, eclectic doorstop anthology.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>New York Magazine</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;The full national-literary character of the United States is on display in this mighty history and reference work for our time.

Versatile social critic and historian Marcus, Harvard University professor of English and African American studies Sollors, and their illustrious board of editors assembled more than 200 commissioned essays, which meander chronologically from 1507 and the first appearance on a map of the name "America" to Barack Obama's election.

A native of Minneapolis, he currently lives in Las Vegas.<br>&nbsp;<br>The first time I saw the tiassa was nine Real Years before I was born. Mafenyi was holding it, and it was so pretty! When I saw it again, two hundred Real Years earlier, I had to take it so I did.<br>I didn&#x2019;t think Mafenyi would mind too much. She hadn&#x2019;t made it to keep. She told me that she made it because she had to, but it shouldn&#x2019;t ever stay with anyone for too long. She used silver that came all the way from Aelma, which is a city on the Chareq River near some mountains called Daeld, which is where the silver was found in the ground.<br>Mafenyi said she melted the silver in a cauldron made of light, and she cut off her hand and put it in the cauldron, and plucked out one of her eyes and put that in, too, and then shaped it while it was still hotter than hot. She worked on it for years and years, so the ears would be so perfect, and you could see candlelight through the wings; she put tiny sapphires in for the eyes. I asked her how come she still had both hands and both eyes, and she said she was a Goddess and so she grew them back. She said I could be a Goddess if I wanted to be, and I said my grandmother was a Goddess and it didn&#x2019;t seem like much fun.<br>When we were done talking I went away, but then I came back. I wanted to just look at it some more, but she was sleeping, and that&#x2019;s when I knew I had to have it, so I took it from her shelf.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t big, but it was so heavy I had to hold it in both hands. I went back home and just held it and looked at it, but I got fingerprints on it so I cleaned it off, and then wrapped it in cloth. I kept it in the cloth after that except when I wanted to look at it.<br>There was a woman named Chuvin. She was an Athyra, and she was very nice. I thought she should have the tiassa, so I left it in her house, then I went off to see a new world being made, which was very exciting.<br>When I got back, I went to look at the silver tiassa, but Chuvin didn&#x2019;t have it anymore. She had made some very pretty psiprints, though, and I got to see them. She gave me one of Yevetna Falls that&#x2019;s so good you can almost get wet looking at it. Mommy said that first, but I think it&#x2019;s funny and true, so I&#x2019;m saying it now. I asked Chuvin what she did with the tiassa, but she said she didn&#x2019;t know, it just got lost somehow.<br>It wasn&#x2019;t hard to find it, though. When you looked in what the Necromancer calls the other place, it was like a big white light, with two blinking blue thingies. I saw it right away, and followed it because I wanted to know where it was, and really I just wanted to see it again. It isn&#x2019;t hard to follow something in the other place, but it&#x2019;s hard to talk about. It&#x2019;s like painting when you don&#x2019;t have paint, or singing when there&#x2019;s no song, or talking when there are no words. I can&#x2019;t explain. Anyway, I followed it.<br>It was an old man who had it. He was a Lyorn and his name was Pindua. He made statues from big pieces of marble. I got to hold the tiassa for a little while, but then I left it with him. He made one called &#x201c;Worill Reclining on Stairway&#x201d; that they put in the Hall of Monuments in the Imperial Palace.<br>A little while after he made it he died and they brought him to the Paths of the Dead. He owed a lot of money when he died, and when that happens they sell all your things to try to pay the people you owe money to, so the tiassa was sold to a man named Paarfi who was a Hawk and who wrote books.<br>I didn&#x2019;t think about it for a long time, but then I remembered it one day a year later, which was almost three hundred Real Years later. I looked for it, and Paarfi still had it. I went to talk to him about it. He talked about what he was writing. He was a nice man.<br>I told him he should give the tiassa away, and he agreed, but said he wanted to keep it a little longer, until he finished his new book. I said that was okay, and he gave me one of his books and signed it for me. He wrote, &#x201c;To Devera, a very special little girl.&#x201d; I took it to Grandma&#x2019;s and put it in the chest with my things, next to the seashell that whistles &#x201c;March to the Kaanas&#x201d; and the psiprint of Yevetna Falls and the tick-ticker and some other stuff I want to keep.<br>While I was there, Grandma asked me what I was doing, and I said I was looking for the silver tiassa and she asked what that was so I explained where it came from. She asked some questions about it, but she had the look she gets when she&#x2019;s being nice and doesn&#x2019;t really care about what you&#x2019;re telling her, so pretty soon I said good-bye and ran off.<br>I went to a place called Tanvir where it was just spring and there were flowers in all the colors there are. After that, I went to an empty tower in a dead city and a man made of metal played music for me. After a while, I started wanting to see the tiassa again, so I went back to fifty Real Years later, and Paarfi still had it. I thought it was long enough, so I took it but left him a note, then I went to Adrilankha ten Real Years ahead and played with Vlad Norathar. I showed him how to look in the other place, and he showed me how to make a spinnystick with glitters.<br>Then I was tired from all the jumping around so I put my spinnystick in the chest and took a nap. Mommy says naps are good for you, but I only take them when I&#x2019;m sleepy. When I woke up again I found Daddy and showed him the tiassa and he said it was very pretty. I asked if he was ever going to come visit me and Mommy and he said he would soon because he wanted his sword back. He looked angry when he said it so I didn&#x2019;t ask about it any more. While I was there Mafenyi came up and said I shouldn&#x2019;t have stolen the tiassa and had to give it back and Daddy told her not to accuse me of stealing but I said I had just borrowed it to give to some people who needed it. They started arguing with each other so I left and took the tiassa with me.<br>I started to Mommy&#x2019;s but then a while later I looked in the other place, and saw Mafenyi was coming after me. I hadn&#x2019;t thought she wanted the tiassa that much. I thought about jumping, but then I could never come back to now. I didn&#x2019;t want to go to Grandma&#x2019;s, because then she would fight Mafenyi and I&#x2019;d feel bad, and if I went to Mommy&#x2019;s I&#x2019;d have to explain what I did.<br>So please, Uncle Vlad. She&#x2019;ll be here soon. Can you take it?<br><br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 2011 by Steven Brust<br></p><h2>Christian Music: A global history</h2><p>Christian Music: A Global History was originally published by Lion Hudson in 2011.

Because SOG operations suffered extraordinary casualties, they required extraordinary soldiers. So when Capt. Thom Nicholson arrived at Command and Control North (CCN) in Da Nang, SOG's northernmost base camp, he knew he was going to be working with the cream of the crop. <br><br>As commander of Company B, CCN's Raider Company, Nicholson commanded four platoons, comprising nearly two hundred men, in some of the war's most deadly missions, including ready-reaction missions for patrols in contact with the enemy, patrol extractions under fire, and top-secret expeditions "over the fence" into Laos, Cambodia, and North Vietnam. Colonel Nicholson spares no one, including himself, as he provides a rare glimpse into the workings of one of the military's most carefully concealed reconnaissance campaigns.</p><p>Thom Nicholson was born in Springfield, Missouri, and grew up in northern Arkansas and southwest Missouri. After graduating from the Missouri School of Mines, he worked briefly in a uranium mine in New Mexico and then entered the U.S. Army. He served as a Special Forces officer in Vietnam in 1966, as an A-team executive officer, and, in 1969, as a Raider Company commander for CCN, MACV-SOG. After being discharged, he joined the U.S. Army Reserve and completed his career in staff and command assignments with special operations and training commands. In 1996, with more than thirty years commissioned service, he retired at the rank of colonel.<br><br>As a civilian, Mr. Nicholson was a registered professional engineer. He received an M.B.A. from Pepperdine University and graduated from National Defense University and the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School. After military and civilian retirement, he started writing novels, many about the Civil War and the American West. He and his wife, Sandra, have five children.1<br> Welcome Back to the War<br> or<br> It&#x2019;s a Dirty Job, but Somebody&#x2019;s Gotta Do It<br> &nbsp;<br> The air was sticky&#x2014;humid and hot, just as I remembered&#x2014;as I stepped off the big silver bird chartered from Pan Am. There was the same old familiar smell; rotted vegetation, sewage, and burned jet exhaust, all fighting for nauseous supremacy. &#x201c;Hell,&#x201d; I grumbled to myself, &#x201c;what&#x2019;d you expect? This is Vietnam, you ain&#x2019;t been gone that long, trooper.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> My thoughts returned to the scene at the airport in St. Louis. My young wife, our two little ones in her arms, all sobbing as I climbed on the plane that was to carry me away from all I loved. I doubt if the boys understood what was going on, they were so young, but the tears being shed by their mother had both of the youngsters wailing away. The sight is etched in my memory forever, all three of my loved ones&#x2019; faces contorted with grief and streaked with tears. I thought my heart was going to break as well. I sat down next to a grandmotherly woman, who wisely looked away while I wiped the tears from my eyes and attempted to compose myself.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Going off to Vietnam, son?&#x201d; she finally asked. The polite question gave me a chance to talk, if I wanted to.<br> &nbsp;<br> I didn&#x2019;t. So I just nodded and turned my face to the window, staring at the white clouds floating beneath the plane. She never said another word to me the rest of the trip to San Francisco. Bless her kind heart.<br> &nbsp;<br> After a time, as the miles between my family and me increased, the lump in my throat diminished enough to allow me to suppress the almost physical pain of leaving. I was to spend the next fifteen months endeavoring to hold back the persistent nausea of separation. Any time I let it surface, the hurt was back, sharp and heart-wrenching as the day I left.<br> &nbsp;<br> I inhaled again the distinctive odor of Vietnam. To this day, I can recall the smell; it has soaked into my memory like sewage on a sponge. I squinted in the harsh sunlight around the concrete apron of the massive air base at Cam Ranh Bay, Republic of South Vietnam. I was a young captain in the U.S. Army arriving for my second tour of duty. I was lean and mean, the product of a refresher course at the Jungle School in Panama, the Canal Zone, and anxious to find out what I would be doing the second time around. I had served the first tour as executive officer in a Special Forces A-team in the Central Highlands of South Vietnam. I had seen the elephant (been under enemy fire), as the old army saying went, and was ready to boss some men in combat, the most challenging assignment to which an army captain could aspire.<br> &nbsp;<br> A continuous relay of F-4 Phantom fighter planes streaked off the hot concrete runway and into the harsh, blue sky, the jet engines&#x2019; roar drowning out any hope of conversation, their sooty, black exhaust drifting away with the slight breeze. The 230 men with me, and a single female soldier, shuffled toward a concrete-block building with a red sign over the door: 2023D PORT AUTHORITY, WELCOME TO SOUTH VIETNAM. Underneath a smaller sign read: NEW ARRIVALS FOLLOW THE ARROWS TO CENTRAL PROCESSING.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sweating in the fierce sun, my group of new arrivals obeyed like mindless automatons and entered a large room at the corner of the building. An air force sergeant, his nose red from sun or booze or both, stood beside a long, wooden table, and, as soon as the door shut behind the last man, launched into a droning monologue about in-processing, how to conduct yourself, etc., etc. I don&#x2019;t remember another word he said and doubt if he could have five minutes after he finished.<br> &nbsp;<br> I glanced around at my fellow travelers, all innocent, new fresh meat for the war. Just then, somewhere else within the building, two hundred plus lucky survivors were hearing their final out-briefing, probably given by another bored sergeant, before loading aboard the plane I&#x2019;d just exited. They were about to depart for a long-awaited return to the real world, the land of the big PX, the good ole U.S.A. &#x201c;Oh well,&#x201d; I consoled myself, &#x201c;only 450 days to go, and counting.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I had decided to extend my tour an extra three months in country. That way, I could go directly to Fort Benning, Georgia, upon my return and enter the Infantry Officers Career Course (IOCC). If I got home too early, I might be sent elsewhere for a year of troop duty, and I wanted to get IOCC behind me before I was assigned to a permanent duty station. I hoped the extra three months would be safe and quiet. My wife threatened to kill me if I got greased away during my extension. Her tongue could be sharper than my Ranger knife. I figured I&#x2019;d hear it in my grave if I made the mistake of dying in Vietnam.<br> &nbsp;<br> Suddenly, the bored NCO&#x2019;s voice cut through my musings. &#x201c;All air force personnel to Room A, army to Room B, and navy-Marines to Room D. Any others to Room C. There, you will be picked up by your respective replacement battalions and taken to temporary billets while awaiting in-country assignment.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> I grabbed my duffel bag, stuffed to the brim with the essentials I needed, like socks, shorts, and a nifty Browning, 13-shot, 9mm pistol I was sneaking in country against regulations. I also had a custom-made hunting vest with extra pockets, my old jungle boots from the first tour, several sets of civvies for relaxing when away from the jungle, and a little ditty bag filled with toilet articles.<br> &nbsp;<br> A couple of first-timers behind me were complaining to no one in particular that they already had orders assigning them to a unit.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t believe it,&#x201d; I counseled, the weight of experience giving me authority to put in my two cents&#x2019; worth. &#x201c;Army Command at Saigon can reassign you to anyplace you may be needed, once you arrive in country. Your orders don&#x2019;t mean squat.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Inside Room B, a sweating sergeant first class (E-7) waited for our arrival, along with several pencil-pushing clerks from the replacement depot. We handed over our orders and were herded to army-green buses outside the door. At the repple depot, located at the far end of the runway, I wasted little time getting under a long, cool shower and into the cot assigned me, with its draped mosquito netting and clean sheets. If I ended up in the 4th Infantry Division, as my orders stated, I&#x2019;d see little of either for a long time.<br> &nbsp;<br> I reported to Officer Assignments early the next morning. To my delight, the personnel major in charge of infantry officers asked me if I wanted to go back to the 5th Special Forces Group. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ve had a few unforeseen casualties and are asking for SF-qualified officers.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;Yes, sir!&#x201d; I was so elated, I nearly shouted. I had hoped to be able to transfer after six months with the 4th Division, but this was better yet. I felt I belonged in Special Forces; the 4th Infantry Division was for grunts, mud-pounders, junglehumpers. I was Airborne Special Forces, a cut above such a mundane assignment. Besides, we got to wear the nifty green beret instead of the standard, army-issue, green baseball cap.<br> &nbsp;<br> The next morning, well before sunrise, I was on the shuttle plane to Nha Trang, the headquarters of the 5th Special Forces Group, anxious to get my duty assignment for the coming year.<br> &nbsp;<br> Was I ever disappointed. &#x201c;S-5 with C Company, Pleiku,&#x201d; the gray-haired older major who was the personnel officer (assistant S-1) at group headquarters told me, as he passed me my assignment orders.<br> &nbsp;<br> I left his office numb with disbelief. S-5 meant Civil Affairs (CA). Assignment to the C-team meant higher headquarters. I&#x2019;d be involved in building dispensaries and rice warehouses for villages of the local area of operations (AO) for C Company, the control headquarters for A-teams in the Central Highlands. I would be a staff puke, as far from the guns as any &#x201c;Saigon cowboy,&#x201d; the derogatory term we field soldiers used for the support people way to the rear. To my mind, Civil Affairs was a nothing job that involved the handling of a lot of Vietnamese money, dealing with local contractors, bribing the various district chiefs to ensure their cooperation, sending out action teams to survey potential CA projects. I wanted a combat assignment, damn it, as long as I was going to be in Vietnam. My first tour had been in a rather quiet district of central Vietnam. I had been the executive officer (XO) of the A-team assigned there, and the action had been sporadic. It made for a long and rather boring year. I wasn&#x2019;t back in Vietnam to pass out tongue depressors; I wanted to shoot it out with the bad guys.<br> &nbsp;<br> I knew the executive officer of the 5th SF Group, Lt. Col. Dan Schungel; I&#x2019;d served under him at Fort Carson, Colorado, in the 5th Mechanized Division, during 1963 and &#x2019;64. Then, I&#x2019;d been a gung-ho lieutenant commanding the heavy mortar platoon of his battalion, the 2/10th Mechanized Infantry. I&#x2019;d worked hard for him, and I hoped he would remember that.<br> &nbsp;</p><h2>Oxherding Tale: A Novel</h2><p>One night in the antebellum South, a slave owner and his African-American butler stay up to all hours until, too drunk to face their wives, they switch places in each other's beds.

Then, in a dramatic turn of events, Charles experiences unprecedented success. He finds a wonderful wife, raises a family, excels in business to such a degree that he creates an empire that is noticed by the President of Kenya, and he becomes a pinnacle in the church movement. Charles is on top of the world. And then his world changes. In spite of his tremendous achievements, the plight of the growing street children problem in his country remains strong in Charles&#39; heart. He is unable to shut out their cries, the cries he understands so well, and he realizes he must respond. Father to the Fatherless tells the true story of a man who makes a decision to sell everything he has to help the poor. It&#39;s a decision that goes so counter-intuitive to those around him that he is soon completely ostracized, forcing him to carry out what seems like an impossible and unexplainable mission. Now, armed only with his relationship with God, Charles and his family struggle on physical, financial and spiritual fronts to rescue street children from the slums of Kenya and provide them with the hope of new life.</p><p></p><h2>Heroine</h2><p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of the Month!

They had a smart gray horse who pulled a shiny black buggy when they went out riding.<br> Prince was the finest horse in town. But no one remembers who took care of that beautiful animal while the aunts were working in their store: perhaps it was a sneaky trader who tried to steal him, perhaps it was a one-legged harmonica player who taught him to dance; perhaps it was two children who once saved Prince's life.<br> Jacqueline Briggs Martin, author of Caldecott winner <i>Snowflake Bentley, </i>really did have two great-aunts who owned a horse like Prince. In <i>The Finest Horse in Town</i> she recreates life in a small American town as it might have been at the turn of the 20th century. Susan Gaber's extraordinary watercolor paintings make the people and events in these three stories truly come alive.</p><p>Jacqueline Briggs Martin is the author of more than a dozen picture books for children, including SNOWFLAKE BENTLEY, winner of the 1999 Caldecott Medal. She grew up on a farm in Maine and heard stories of the two great-aunts featured in THE FINEST HORSE IN TOWN. She now lives in Iowa. <p>Susan Gaber is working on the illustrations for her nineteenth picture book for children. She has illustrated one other book written by Jacqueline Briggs Martin, GOOD TIMES ON GRANDFATHER MOUNTAIN. She lives in Huntington, New York, with her husband and son.</p>This tale of two sisters who run a dry-goods store in horse-and-buggy-era Maine is based on the long-lost family story of Martin's two great-aunts. The author of the Bizzy Bones books has spun a gossamer prose poem of unaffected sweetness, told as a series of vignettes that speculate on who might have tended the sisters' magnificent horse, Prince, while the two women were minding the store. Could it have been an unscrupulous horse trader, who almost duped the sisters out of their prize stallion? Or was it a one-legged logger, who taught Prince to dance to the strains of a harmonica? As Martin points out in her wistful refrain, "An old watchmaker told us / what he remembered. / And he was there." Remembered only in fragments, the story is essentially a slender one; but the beauty of its nostalgic, sing-song language and descriptions of village life more than compensate for its lack of substance. Gaber's ( The Woman Who Flummoxed the Fairies ) exquisite watercolors have the naive beauty of early American folk paintings.

Art scams are increasingly convincing and involve incredible sums of money. The cons perpetrated by unscrupulous art dealers and their accomplices are proportionately elaborate. </p><p>Anthony M. Amore's <i>The Art of the Con </i>tells the stories of some of history's most notorious yet untold cons. They involve stolen art hidden for decades; elaborate ruses that involve the Nazis and allegedly plundered art; the theft of a conceptual prototype from a well-known artist by his assistant to be used later to create copies; the use of online and television auction sites to scam buyers out of millions; and other confidence scams incredible not only for their boldness but more so because they actually worked. Using interviews and newly released court documents, <i>The Art of the Con</i> will also take the reader into the investigations that led to the capture of the con men, who oftentimes return back to the world of crime.

Not even when he tries, and that afternoon, he was trying his damnedest. He was downwind of me, at least two hundred feet away, so I couldn't smell him, see him or hear him. But I knew he was there.<br><br> As I stood under the oaks, I couldn't suppress a twinge of resentment at the pressure his presence added to an already gut-twisting situation. Yes, I'd been the one to suggest the run, leaping up from the lunch table and declaring I was ready. He'd asked if he should stay inside&#x2014;possibly the first time in our fifteen-year relationship that Clay had been willing to give me space. But I'd grabbed his hand and dragged him out with me. Now I was blaming him for being here. Not fair. But better than to admit that what I felt was not resentment but fear&#x2014;fear that I would fail, and in failing I would disappoint him.<br><br> I took a deep breath and filled my lungs with the loamy richness of a forest emerging from winter, the first buds appearing tentatively, as if still uncertain. Uncertain . . . good word. That was what I felt: uncertainty.<br><br> Uncertainty? Try abject, pant-pissing, stomach-heaving terror&#x2014;<br><br> I took another deep breath. The scent of the forest filled me, called to me, like Clay's presence out there, beckoning&#x2014;<br><br> Don't think of him. Just relax.<br><br> I followed the sound of a rabbit thumping nearby, upwind and oblivious of me. As I moved, I saw my shadow and realized I was still standing. Well, there was the first problem. I'd undressed, but how would I Change if I was still on two legs?<br><br> As I started to crouch, a pang ran through the left side of my abdomen and I froze, heart pounding. It was probably a random muscle spasm or a digestive complaint. And yet . . .<br><br> My fingers rubbed the hard swell of my belly. There was definitely a swell there, however staunchly Jeremy swore otherwise. I could feel it with my hand, feel it in the tightening waistband of my jeans. Clay tried to avoid the question&#x2014;smart man&#x2014;but when pressed he would admit I did seem to be showing already. Showing, when I was no more than five weeks pregnant. That shouldn't be. Yet one more thing to add to my growing list of worries.<br><br> At the top of the list was this: the regular transformation from human to wolf that my body required. I had to Change, but what would it do to my baby?<br><br> My fear over losing my child came as a revelation to me. In the nearly three years I'd wrestled with the thought of having a baby, I'd considered the possibility that the choice wouldn't be mine to make, that being a werewolf might mean I wouldn't be able to conceive or carry a child to term. I'd accepted that. If my pregnancy ended, I'd know that I couldn't have a child. That would be that.<br><br> Now that I was actually pregnant I couldn't believe I'd been so cavalier. This was more than a collection of cells growing in me, it was the actualization of a dream I'd thought I'd lost when I became a werewolf. A dream I was certain I'd given up when I decided to stay with Clay.<br><br> But I had to Change. Already I'd waited too long, and I could feel the need in every muscle spasm and restless twitch, hear it in my growls and snaps whenever someone spoke to me. Twice I'd come out here with Clay, and twice I'd been unable&#x2014;or refused&#x2014;to Change. Make it a third, and Clay and Jeremy would be flipping coins to see who locked me in the cage. That was a safety precaution&#x2014;being Change-deprived makes us violent and unpredictable&#x2014;but given my surly behavior this past week, I wouldn't blame them if they fought over the privilege.<br><br> Just Change, goddamn it! Get down on your knees . . . See? That feels fine, right? Now put your hands on the ground . . . There. Now concentrate&#x2014;<br><br> My body rebelled, convulsing so hard I doubled over, gasping. Change into a wolf? With a baby inside me? Was I crazy? I'd rip, tear, suffocate&#x2014;<br><br> No!<br><br> I pushed up onto all fours and cleared my head, then opened the gate only to thoughts bearing the pass-code of logic. Was this my first Change since I'd become pregnant? No. It was the first since I'd learned I was pregnant, two weeks ago. I must have Changed a half-dozen times between conception and testing.<br><br> Had anything happened during those Changes? Bleeding? Cramping? No.<br><br> So stop worrying. Take a deep breath, smell the forest, dig your fingers into the damp soil, hear the whistle of the April wind, feel the ache in your muscles. Run to Clay, who'll be so happy, so relieved . . .<br><br> My skin prickled, stretching, itching as fur sprouted&#x2014;<br><br> My brain threw up the brakes again and my body tensed. Sweat trickled down my cheeks. I growled and dug my fingers and toes into the soft earth, refusing to reverse the process.<br><br> Relax, relax, relax. Just stop worrying and let your body do the work. Like constipation. Relax and nature takes over.<br><br> Constipation? Oh, there was a romantic analogy. I laughed, and my changing vocal cords squeezed the sound into a hideous screech, more worthy of a hyena than a wolf, which only made me laugh all the harder. I toppled sideways and, as I lay there, laughing, I finally relaxed.<br><br> The Change took over, spontaneous. My convulsions of laughter turned to spasms of pain, and I twisted and writhed on the ground. The pain of a Change. Yet some still-panicked part of my brain convinced me this wasn't the normal kind of pain&#x2014;I was killing my child, suffocating it as my body contorted.<br><br> I must&#x2014;Must stop&#x2014;Oh, God, I couldn't!<br><br> I tried to stop&#x2014;fighting, snarling, concentrating on reversing to human. But it was too late. I'd waited too long, and now my body was determined to see it through.<br><br> Finally, the pain ended, gone without so much as a lingering ache, and I lay on my side, panting, then leapt to my feet.<br><br> Damn it, not so fast! Be careful.<br><br> I stood there, motionless except for my tail, which wouldn't stop whipping from side to side, as if to say "Well, we're Changed. What are you waiting for? Let's run!" The rest of my body didn't disagree with the sentiment, though it let the tail do the shouting, settling for subtler displays of restlessness: heart tripping, ears swiveling, muscles tensing. I refused to move, though; not until I'd taken inventory, made sure everything was as it should be.<br><br> First, my belly. No obvious signs of distress. I panted, letting my chest rise and fall, testing whether the movement seemed to hurt anything. It didn't, though my stomach did let out a growl as that nearby rabbit's scent wafted past. You wouldn't know I'd just devoured a three-course lunch. Ungrateful stomach. But the other part of my belly, newly filling with life, felt fine.<br><br> I lifted my paws one at a time, stretching and rotating my joints. Good. My nose and ears had done fine picking up that rabbit. And the still-wagging tail was obviously working. Okay, enough of this.<br><br> I stepped forward. One paw, two, three, four . . . No sudden scream of complaint from my belly. I broke into a lope, then a run, then a headlong dash across the clearing. Still no signs of distress.<br><br> Next, the tougher moves&#x2014;the wolf maneuvers. I crouched, wiggled my hindquarters, then leapt at an imaginary mouse. As I hit the ground, I wheeled around, teeth bared as I snapped at an unseen foe. I bounded across the clearing. I jumped and twisted in midair. I pranced. I lunged. I charged. I chased my tail&#x2014;<br><br> A wheezing sound erupted behind me and I froze, the tip hairs of my tail still caught between my teeth. There, across the clearing, was a huge, golden-haired wolf, his head between his forepaws, eyes closed, hindquarters in the air, body quivering with that strange wheezing noise. His eyes opened, bright blue eyes dancing with relief and amusement, and I realized what that noise was. He was laughing at me.<br><br> Laughing? I'd just gone through a horrible trauma, and the guy had the nerve to laugh? I knew half of that laughter was relief at seeing me Changed, and I admit I probably looked a little silly gallivanting alone in the clearing. But still, such indignities should not be tolerated.<br><br> With as much grace as I could muster with tail fur hanging out of my mouth, I swept around and stalked in the other direction. Halfway across the clearing, I wheeled and charged, teeth bared. His eyes widened in "oh, shit" comprehension and he backpedaled just in time to get out of my way, then bolted into the forest.<br><br> I tore after him. I loped along the path, muzzle skimming the ground. The earth was thick with the scent of my prey&#x2014;a deliberate move, as he weaved and circled, permeating this patch of forest with his smell, hoping to throw me off the trail.<br><br> I untangled the web of trails and latched onto the most recent. As I picked up speed, the ground whooshed past beneath me. Ahead, the path opened into a clearing. I pitched forward, straining for the open run, but before I hit the edge of the clearing, I dug in my claws and skidded to a graceless stop.<br><br> I stood there, adrenaline roaring, urging me to find him, take him down. I closed my eyes and shuddered. Too eager. Keep that up and I'd run straight into a trap. After a moment, the adrenaline rush ebbed and I started forward again, cautious now, ears straining, muzzle up, sniffing as I walked.<br><br> My eyes saved me this time. That and the sun, peeking from fast-moving clouds. One break in the cloud cover and I caught the glint of gold through the trees. He was downwind, crouched to the left of the path's end, waiting for me to come barreling out.<br><br> I retraced my last few steps, walking backward. An awkward maneuver&#x2014;some things easily accomplished on two legs are much more difficult to coordinate with four. Once I'd gone as far as I could, I craned to look over my shoulder. The trees closed in on me from either side. Not enough room to guarantee a silent about-face.<br><br> I took a careful step off the path. The undergrowth was soft and moist with spring rain. I prodded at it, but it stayed silent. Hunkering down to stay below branch level, I started forward, looping to slink up behind him. Once close enough to see through the trees, I peered out. He was crouched beside the path, as still as a statue, only the twitch of his tail betraying his impatience.<br><br> I found the clearest line of fire, hunched down, then sprang. I hit him square on the back and sank my teeth into the ruff around his neck. He yelped and started to rear up, then stopped. I let out a growling chuckle, knowing he didn't dare throw me off in my "condition." All I had to do was hang on&#x2014;<br><br> He dropped, letting his legs fold, his body cushioning my drop, but the suddenness of it was enough of a surprise that I let go of his ruff. As he slid from under me, he twisted and pinned me, his teeth clamping around the bottom of my muzzle. I kicked at his underbelly. He snorted as my claws made contact, but made no move to fight back.<br><br> He looked down at me, indecision flickering in his eyes. Then he released my muzzle and his head shot down to my throat. I wriggled, trying to pull out of the way, but he only buried his nose in the ruff around my neck and inhaled deeply. He shuddered, legs vibrating against my sides. A moment's hesitation. Then a soft growl, and he twisted off me and dove into the woods again.<br><br> I scrambled to my feet and set off in pursuit. This time he had too much of a head start, and I could only get close enough to see his hindquarters bounding ahead. He flicked his tail up. Mocking me, damn him. I surged forward, getting close enough to hear the pounding of his heartbeat. He veered and crashed into the forest, off the trail, and I chortled to myself. Now I had him. Cutting a fresh path would slow him down just enough to let me&#x2014;<br><br> A brace of ptarmigan flew up, almost under my feet, and I slid to a halt, nearly flipping over backward in my surprise. As the panicked birds took to the sky, I got my bearings again, looked around . . . and found myself alone. Tricked. Damn him. And damn me for falling for it.<br><br> I found his trail, but before I'd gone a hundred feet, a gurgling moan rippled through the silence. I stopped, ears going up. A grunt, then panting. He was Changing.<br><br> I dove into the nearest thicket and began my own Change. It came fast, spurred by a healthy double shot of adrenaline and frustration. When I finished, he was still in his thicket.<br><br> I crept around to the other side, pulled back a handful of leaves and peered through. He was done, but recovering, crouched on all fours, panting as he caught his breath. By the rules of fair play, I should have given him time to recuperate. But I wasn't in the mood for rules.<br><br> I sprang onto his back. Before he could react, my arm went around his neck, forearm jammed against his windpipe.<br><br> I leaned over his shoulder. "Did you think you could escape that easily?"<br><br> His lips formed an oath, but no sound came out. His shoulders slumped, as if defeated. Like I was stupid enough to buy that. I pretended to relax my grip. Sure enough, the second I did, he twisted, trying to grab me.<br><br> I slid off his back and pulled him down sideways. Before he could recover, I was on top of him, my forearm again at his throat. His hands slid up my sides, snuck around and cupped my breasts.<br><br> "Uh-uh," I growled, pressing against his windpipe. "No distractions."<br><br> He sighed and let his hands slide away. I eased back. As soon as I did, he flipped me over, still far more gently than usual, and pinned me as securely as he had in wolf-form. He eased down, belly and groin against mine. He slid his hands back to my breasts and grinned at me, daring me to do something about it now.<br><br> I glared up at him. Then I shot forward and sank my teeth into his shoulder. He jerked away. I scrambled up, then pinned him, hands on his shoulders, knees on his thighs. He struggled, but couldn't get me off without throwing me.</p><h2>Creative Capital: Georges Doriot and the Birth of Venture Capital</h2><p>Venture capitalists are the handmaidens of innovation.

In recent years readers have been absorbed by media accounts of a transplanted hand, an experiment that ultimately ended in amputation. Medical ethicists reason that a hand, unlike a heart or a liver--essential organs conveniently housed out of sight--is in full view and one of a pair, arguably dispensable. In his 10th novel, however, John Irving undertakes to imagine just such a transplant, which involves a donor, a recipient, a surgeon, a particular Green Bay Packer fan, and the remarkable left hand that brings them together.<p> Television reporter Patrick Wallingford becomes a story himself when he loses his hand to a caged lion while in India covering a circus. The moment is captured live on film, and Patrick (who wears a "perpetual but dismaying smile--the look of someone who knows he's met you before but can't recall the exact occasion") is henceforth known as the lion guy. Before long, plans are made to equip Patrick with a new hand. Doctor Nicholas M. Zajac, superstar surgeon, indefatigable dog-poop scooper, runner, and part-time father, is poised to perform the operation. But the donor--or rather the widow of the donor--has a few stipulations. Doris Clausen wants to meet the one-handed reporter before the procedure, and insists on visitation rights afterward. Irving weaves these characters and a panoply of others together in a smart, funny, readable narrative. Often farcical, <i>The Fourth Hand</i> is ultimately something more: a tender chronicle of the redemptive power of love. <i>--Victoria Jenkins</i></p>&#x201c;A RICH AND DEEPLY MOVING TALE . . .

It has been seminal in informing and inspiring the global movement to recognize rights for Nature &#x2013; a movement destined to shape the twenty-first century as significantly as the human rights movements shaped the twentieth century. This revised edition includes a new preface, postscript and the Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth proclaimed on 22 April 2010. Wild Law presents a vision of how we could transform the systems that structure and order industrialised societies to enable us to rediscover a viable role for our species within the Earth community.</p><p><b>Fr. Thomas Berry</b> (1914&#x2013;2009) was one the world&#x2019;s leading thinkers on human relationships with the natural world. Monk, philosopher, cultural historian and author, he considered himself to be a &#x2018;geologian&#x2019; or earth scholar rather than a theologian. An eloquent and passionate spokesperson for the Earth, he has been described as &#x201c;one of the most eminent cultural historians of our time&#x201d; and by <i>Newsweek </i>as &#x201c;the most provocative figure among the new breed of eco-theologians&#x201d;. <b>Cormac Cullinan </b>is an author, practicing environmental attorney, and governance expert who has worked on environmental governance issues in more than twenty countries. He is a director both of Cullinan and Associates, Inc., a specialist environmental and green-business law firm, and the governance consultancy EnAct International.&#34;Every now and then, an idea emerges that helps the human species to evolve. Wild Law is one such idea and is brilliantly explained in this book. Cormac Cullinan leads us toward a new relationship with Mother Earth - just in time.&#34; Maude Barlow - activist, co-founder of the Blue Planet Project &#34;Even in an age that feels itself to be enlightened and humane, and condemns cruelty to animals, and claims to take &#34;the environment&#34; seriously, the idea of &#34;Wild Law&#34; still seems, to many, to be bizarre. How can wild creatures, or landscapes, be granted the same kind of respect - the same rights - in law, as a human being? Yet, as Cormac Cullinan argues so powerfully, the morality of this is clear, and the logic of the case seems impeccable. Indeed we should be asking, can we claim to be fully civilized in the absence of such laws?&#34; Colin Tudge - author of &#39;The Secret Life of Trees&#39; &#34;This book of Cormac Cullinan explains with great clarity how we can change our entire approach to governance so that we can continue life on a liveable planet. In its basic outlines this book is one of the finest contributions to the entire field of jurisprudence in recent times.&#34; Thomas Berry - author of &#39;The Dream of the Earth&#39;, &#39;The Universe Story&#39; and &#39;The Great Work&#39; &#34;Wild Law is a stimulating, eminently readable response to our governance crisis. The survival of our species and health of the Earth family depends on our ability to transform governance systems so that humans become part of the ecological matrix of biological and cultural diversity. This book is a milestone on that path.&#34; Dr Vandana Shiva - President of the Research Foundation for Science, Technology and Ecology &#34;The arrogance of the &#39;civilised&#39; world has blinded it to the wisdom of the wisdom of the indigenous people for too long. Cormac Cullinan&#39;s call for the indigenous voices and the wisdom of thousands of years of human experience to be heard in the heart of our governance systems is both timely and powerful. This provocative and groundbreaking book is an important milestone in the process of finding a viable ecological role for contemporary human societies.&#34; Marin von Hildebrand - co-ordinator of COAMA &#34;We desperately need some new thinking today about systems of global governance. We&#39;re stuck with the same obselete, ignore-the-earth institutions that were brought into being after the 2nd World War, and they&#39;re now failing is ever more catastrophically. Wild Law shows just how radical we now need to be in creating new institutions that are genuinely &#39;fit for purpose&#39; in the 21st Century. Jonathon Porritt - Director of Forum for the Future &#34;We urgently need to rethink our legal and political systems if we are to stop environemntal destruction. The radical ideas in Wild Law will give both lawyers and grass-root activists the tools they need to start the process.&#34; Michael Meacher - former UK Minister for the Environment &#34;Wild Law is to law what quantum physics is to physics.&#34; Alessandro Pelizzion - co-founder of Earth Laws</p><h2>Bog Bodies Uncovered: Solving Europe&#39;s Ancient Mystery</h2><p><p><strong>The grisly story of the bog bodies, updated via details of archaeological discovery and crime-scene techniques</strong></p> Some 2,000 years ago, certain unfortunate individuals were violently killed and buried not in graves but in bogs.

Most of these ancient swamp victims have been discovered in regions with large areas of raised bog: Ireland, northwest England, Denmark, the Netherlands, and northern Germany. They were almost certainly murder victims and, as such, their bodies and their burial places can be treated as crime scenes.

Before they know how it happened, they are at odds with their teenage housekeeper, overwhelmed by a zany spiritualist who seems determined to take over their lives, and, most horrifying of all, on the wrong side of the law. But while they wrestle with one misfortune after another, forces are at work behind the scenes that have put unrelated strangers on the road to The Hummingbird House, where accidents become destiny, defeat is transformed into victory, and all that is required for a miracle is an open heart. <p>Welcome to The Hummingbird House, where you may not find what you expect, but you'll always find what you need.</p><p> Praise for Donna Ball's <i>Ladybug Farm</i> series:</p><p> "A must read." --Examiner.com </p><p> "Absolutely delectable" --Publisher's Weekly </p><p> "Hilarious and heartwarming" --North Carolina Pilot</p></p><p>Donna Ball is the author of over a hundred novels under several different pseudonyms in a variety of genres that include romance, mystery, suspense, paranormal, western adventure, historical and women&#x2019;s fiction.

Although supply problems, issues with discipline, and poor training hampered the Continentals' effectiveness in combat, they were able to inflict a decisive defeat on the British at Yorktown. In contrast, the backbone of the British forces in North America were long-service regular infantrymen, serving for the most part in single-battalion regiments. They had earned a formidable reputation on Europe's battlefields during the Seven Years' War, but in fighting the French in North America during that conflict had already learned a great deal about the very different fighting conditions prevalent in the New World.</p><p>In a host of encounters ranging from skirmishes to decisive pitched battles, the infantrymen of both sides would be tested to the limit, with supply problems, hostile terrain, and poor weather all adding to the horrors of close-quarter combat.

Original.</p><p><p><strong>Maria Poggi Johnson</strong> grew up in Scotland and has studied at Oxford University and the University of Virginia. She currently lives with her husband and four children in Northeastern Pennsylvania, and teaches theology at the University of Scranton.</p>A Catholic and a professor of theology at the University of Scranton, Johnson lives near a small community of ultra-Orthodox Jews. In this winsome volume, she explores the ways friendships with her neighbors have subtly reshaped her own Christian commitments. She finds the Jewish practice of reading Torah alongside Talmudic commentary enjoyable and recognizes that she, too, likes to study the Bible with "partners"&#x2014;be they the ancient church fathers or her husband. In the Jewish dietary codes, Johnson finds a model of bodily spirituality, a useful antidote to the Gnosticism that has historically infected the church. Johnson isn't moved by every aspect of Jewish life; while she shares the goal of imparting religious convictions to her children, she worries that her neighbors' approach&#x2014;more or less cutting their children off from wider American culture&#x2014;carries too great a cost. Still, she sees life in her neighborhood as "elementary preparation for civilized participation in the global village." At times, the book is thin&#x2014;her ruminations on Jewish suffering are so brief as to seem glib, for example. But on the whole, this is a welcome contribution to the literature of Jewish-Christian relations. <i>(Nov. 7)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

People in Dogwood, West Virginia, say he was born with a second helping of brains and a gift for playing the mandolin but was cut short on social skills. Though he&#x2019;d gladly give you the shirt off his back, they were right. Billy longs to use his life as an ode to God, a lyrical, beautiful bluegrass song played with a finely tuned heart. So with spare parts from a lifetime of collecting, he builds a radio station in his own home. People in town laugh. But Billy carries a brutal secret that keeps him from significance and purpose. Things always seem to go wrong for him.<br><br>However small his life seems, from a different perspective Billy&#x2019;s song reaches far beyond the hills and hollers he calls home. Malachi is an angel sent to observe Billy. Though it is not his dream assignment, Malachi follows the man and begins to see the bigger picture of how each painful step Billy takes is a note added to a beautiful symphony that will forever change the lives of those who hear it.</p><p><i>&#x201c;I suppose you can sum up a man&#x2019;s life with a few words, but I need to put this story down to fill in the missing pieces. Or perhaps I can convince the people who know me as a hermit that there was some reason for it all. But this is not really for those outside looking in. This is for me.&#x201d;</i><br><br>Some people say Billy Allman has a heart of gold. Others say he&#x2019;s a bit odd. The truth is, they&#x2019;re all right. He&#x2019;s a hillbilly genius&#x2015;a collector, a radio whiz&#x2015;and he can make the mandolin sing. Though he dreams of making an impact on the world beyond the hills and hollers of Dogwood, West Virginia, things just always seem to go wrong. <br><br>But however insignificant Billy&#x2019;s life seems, it has not gone unnoticed. Malachi is an angel sent to observe and protect Billy. Though it&#x2019;s not his dream assignment, Malachi always follows orders. And as Billy&#x2019;s story unfolds, Malachi slowly begins to see the bigger picture&#x2015;that each step Billy takes is a note added to a beautiful song that will forever change the lives of those who hear it.Fabry (Dogwood; June Bug), who writes for children and adults, will certainly delight his ever enlarging fan base with this mesmerizing tale about a man whose gifts are clear to anyone interested in seeing past his obvious outer limitations. Billy Allman, gifted intellectually and especially skilled at playing the mandolin, lives his life as an offering to his divine creator. Billy epitomizes humility as he quietly works to build his own radio station with limited resources and against tremendous spiritual opposition. Day by day, year after year, Billy stays the course despite significant losses that follow him through life. Fabry's story will surprise readers in the best possible way; plot twists unfold and unexpected character transformations occur throughout this tender story of a single gentle soul who chooses to live by faith despite hardship, failure, and disappointment. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He attended Harvard University, from which he was graduated with a Bachelor of Arts Degree in 1908. He studied at the Ecole Libre des Sciences Politiques, Paris, France, in 1908-1909, and returned to Harvard for postgraduate work, receiving the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in 1912. Thereafter he became Instructor, first at the University of California in Berkeley, and in 1915 at Harvard. Except for three years (1922-1925) when he was Harmsworth Professor of American History at Oxford, England, and his periods of active duty during both World Wars, he remained continuously at Harvard University as lecturer and professor until his retirement in 1955.</p><h2>The Cinnamon Shops and Other Stories (Writings by Bruno Schulz)</h2><p>In The Cinnamon Shops and Other Stories, Bruno Schulz describes in fantastical, mythologised terms the cloth merchant&#39;s shop where he grew up and the bizarre antics of his father, such as turning the attic into an aviary and expounding strange theories on mannequins. Two sides of the Galician town of Drohobycz are seen: the old town full of ancient mystery is contrasted with newer districts that have sprung up in response to oil mining in the area. The language is poetic, heady and oneiric, employing a rich system of imagery incorporating books and labyrinths.</p><p>Bruno Schulz (1892-1942) was born into a family of cloth merchants who owned a shop on the market square of Drohobycz. Schulz rarely left the town; although the town itself would pass in his lifetime from Austrian to Polish, to Soviet and to Nazi jurisdiction. Schulz became an art teacher there, at his old school. He wrote his stories there, mythologised accounts of his own childhood, the progressive illness of his ageing father, and the family&#39;s descent into financial ruin; stories populated by outr� relatives and townspeople who testify richly to a way of life now gone, swept away in the Holocaust. Schulz would be murdered in the town in which he was born by a Nazi officer who then reportedly went to a colleague to say, &#34;You shot my Jew, so I have shot yours.&#34; Schulz&#39;s fame rests on his talents both as a writer and a visual artist; he first gained renown in 1922, when his collection of stylish and erotic clich�-verre pictures, The Book of Idolatry, was presented in Warsaw and L&#39;vov. But it is his two volumes of short stories, The Cinnamon Shops (1934) and The Sanatorium at the Sign of the Hourglass (1937), that have gained him immortality and a reputation as the greatest modern prose stylist of the Polish language.</p><h2>Sacred Number and the Origins of Civilization: The Unfolding of History Through the Mystery of Number</h2><p>An exploration of the origins and influences of number from prehistory to modern time <br><br>� Reveals the deeper meaning of the symbols and esoteric knowledge of secret societies <br><br>� Explains the numerical sophistication of ancient monuments <br><br>� Shows how the Templar design for Washington, D.C., represents the New Jerusalem <br><br>The ubiquitous use of certain sacred numbers and ratios can be found throughout history, influencing everything from art and architecture to the development of religion and secret societies.

He completed his residency training in Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at Johns Hopkins and was awarded an NIH Fellowship in Stroke Research at the University of Maryland. Today he is a double-board certified Physiatric Interventional Pain Specialist. He lives with his wife and in Atlanta, Georgia. Steve who is a native of Southern California, was not raised in a Christian home. While attending UCLA, his life was &#34;interrupted&#34; by a sensation he had never experienced before or even knew human beings could experience. Had that been the end of it, the sensation may have been dismissed as a mere fluke or some twist of the brain, but the sensation returned again and again. As a Psychobiology undergraduate student, he began to search out what caused these sensations. Along with his scientific inquires he also began to read histories, biographies, and treatises on psychology, world religions and theology. He even traveled overseas and spent time in a Tibetan monastery in Nepal. Eventually Steve read a book written by a man which would forever change his life. The man was C.S. Lewis and in his Surprised by Joy, Steve discovered a person who experienced his same sensations, yet did not forsake the use of reason and rational inquiry. The book was the final instrument that led to Steve&#39;s realization that Christ was who He claimed to be. After the four years leading to his conversion, Steve sought out several people and sources to help him deepen his relationship with Christ. Here again C.S. Lewis proved to be an invaluable guide. In Mere Christianity, Steve found a wonderful expression of Romans 1-8 leading the believer from compatibility to intimacy with Christ.<p>I recommend the book for all who take their faith seriously and want to grow to be all they can be in Christ.</p><p>Jerry Root, Editor of <em>The Quotable C.S.

She lives in Northern California.<i>Chapter One</i><br> Earlier that morning, the call had come while Inspector Kate Martinelli of the San Francisco Police Department was in the middle of a highly volatile negotiation.<br><br> "I'll hurt myself," the person on the other side of the room threatened.<br><br> "Now, that's no good." Kate's response employed the voice of patient reason that she had clung to for the last few minutes, as she desperately wished that the official negotiator would return and take command.<br><br> "Yes it is good." Her opponent saw with crystal clarity that self-destruction was a powerful weapon against Kate.<br><br> "Now, think about it, sweetie. If you hurt yourself, it's going to hurt."<br><br> The mop of curly yellow hair went still as the green eyes narrowed in thought, and Kate's soul contracted with the weird mixture of stifled laughter and heart-wrenching submission that had welled up inside ten thousand times over the past three years and ten months: The child was so like her mother--her looks, her intelligence, her innate sensitivity--she might have been a clone. Kate pushed the sensation away from her throat and said, still reasonable, "We'd all be sad if you were hurt, but you would be the one that was hurting. Now, if you let me lift you down from there, we'll talk about whether you're old enough and careful enough to play with those things."<br><br> "I'm careful," the child insisted.<br><br> "You come down, and then we'll talk about it," Kate repeated. A good negotiator only retreated so far, then stood firm.<br><br> It worked. Nora's chubby little arms went out and Kate moved quickly forward before her daughter tumbled off the high shelf. The arms clung to her fiercely, giving lie to the small person's declaration of fearlessness; Kate's arms clung just as hard.<br><br> Then she set the child firmly down and bent to look directly into those large, bright eyes, arranging her face so she would look very serious. "Nora, you must never do that again. It really would make me very, very sad if you hurt yourself falling down."<br><br> "And Mamalee."<br><br> "Yes, and Mama Lee, too." In fact, Kate was wondering if it might even be possible to negotiate her way into an agreement with Nora that Lee not be told about this little episode, but voices in the hallway and the sounds of the front door, followed by the approach of Lee's uneven footsteps, told her that it wasn't going to happen.<br><br> And indeed, the moment Lee cleared the doorway Nora popped out from behind Kate and informed her mother, "I climbed up high and Mamakay said that if I comed down we'd talk about if I could play with the dollies."<br><br> "I had to pee," Kate explained guiltily. "Thirty seconds, and when I came out the little monkey was up on the sideboard."<br><br> There ensued a protracted discussion as to the nature of trust, which was Lee's current teaching concept, and Kate had to admit, the child seemed to follow most of what her PhD, psychotherapist mother had to say on the matter. After she'd put her two cents' worth in, telling Lee about Nora's willingness to harm herself if it got her the delicate Russian nesting dolls, the discussion turned to the evils of blackmail. That, however, seemed to exhaust the child's patience, and she interrupted to demand that she be given the dolls.<br><br> "Not today," Lee said firmly. And over the protest, she explained, "If you hadn't climbed up high after them, if you'd just asked us about it, we might have said yes. But because you didn't, you're going to have to wait until tomorrow."<br><br> It was scary, Kate reflected not for the first time, how reasonable the child was: She pouted for a count of five, then allowed Lee to take her hand and lead her to the kitchen for a discussion of the weekend itinerary. Kate watched the two blond heads, the two slim bodies, the two sets of unreliable legs--one pair made so by youth, the other by a bullet--as her partner and their daughter settled in to discuss the relative lunchtime merits of turkey versus peanut butter.<br><br> Only then did she remember the phone call that she'd been on her way to answer when she'd glanced up to see the little body clambering high above the hardwood floor. She went over and punched the playback on the machine, and heard the dispatcher ask for her to call back, then add that she was going to call Al Hawkin as well. Kate didn't bother calling Ops, just hit Al's number on the speed dial. From the sound of the background noise when he picked up, he was in the car.<br><br> "Hawkin."<br><br> "Hey, Al," she said. "What did the Ops center want?"<br><br> "There's a body in the park--but it's the other side of the bridge."<br><br> "In Marin? So why call us?"<br><br> "Jurisdiction over there's an absolute bitch, but the vic lives over here and it looks like the park's just the dump site. So until we find the murder site, the Park Police investigator, and his supervisor, thought we should be brought in early, in case it ends up in our hands. They've already called our Crime Scene out for the site."<br><br> "Marin's going to have a fit."<br><br> "Our side's going to have the fit. I'd say, if you're doing anything, don't break up your Saturday."<br><br> "No, I should come if you're going, and I think Lee's finished with her clients for the day. Let me just check with her."<br><br> "Why don't you call me if you don't want me to come by? I'm about twenty minutes out." Which meant he'd not been home when he got the call--he lived about an hour south of the city, but knowing Al, he had his full kit with him wherever he'd been, briefcase, forms, gun.<br><br> "Will do. Do you want anything to eat?"<br><br> "Jani and I had a big breakfast, so no thanks."<br><br> "Twenty minutes."<br><br> "Oh, and Kate? The guy said to wear sturdy shoes and a warm coat."<br><br> "Thanks for the warning."<br><br> Lee scowled at the news that Kate would be leaving, but she'd known that Kate was on call, and she'd been with Kate long enough to know that sometimes life came first, and sometimes death did.<br><br> "Can you call if you're not going to be home for dinner? I told Nora we'd make pizza."<br><br> Nora was neatly distracted from the disappointment of Kate's departure by the reminder. "Yay, pizza!" she cried with a jubilant dance.<br><br> "It should be fine, it may not even be our case, depending on how the lines are drawn on jurisdiction, but the d.b. lived here, so they offered us a look-in."<br><br> "Oh, what a treat," Lee said dryly.<br><br> "What's a deebee?" Nora piped up.<br><br> Kate gave her partner an apologetic glance and opened her mouth to try for an explanation about dead bodies that would satisfy the child without planting macabre images in her impressionable mind, but Lee had already begun with, "Well, you see, sweetheart . . ." Kate slipped away, letting Lee deal with that particular matter.<br><br> Seventeen minutes later, Kate was out in front of the house, waiting for Al Hawkin's car to round the corner. A neighbor came along the sidewalk at a snail's pace, a dog leash in one hand and a toddler's hand in the other. She greeted Kate, reminding Kate of the planning meeting the following week at the preschool, inquiring about the acupuncturist Lee had mentioned a while ago, and tossing out ideas for the upcoming street fair. The entire conversation was held with the woman moving slowly past, never quite coming to a halt while dog and toddler explored the street; the trio continued at the same pace until the corner, when they turned toward the park.<br><br> Kate smiled, and raised a hand to wave to another neighbor. She and Lee had lived in the Noe Valley neighborhood for nearly eight years, and never had a place felt more like home. Kate rarely thought anymore about the magnificent house on tony Russian Hill where they had once lived, cop and therapist rubbing shoulders with the city's cream of socialites and politicos. That place had been Lee's, an inheritance from her overbearing and disapproving mother, and had looked out on two incomparable bridges, San Francisco Bay, Alcatraz Island, and Mount Tamalpais in the background. When Lee finally decided to put the house on the market, it had sold before the print was dry on the advertisement, for more money than Kate could envision.<br><br> They had traded the gorgeous, intricately constructed Arts and Crafts-style house with the million-dollar view for a tumbledown Victorian whose chief virtue in their eyes was also, as far as the listing agent was concerned, its chief drawback: The elderly couple who had lived in the house all the five decades of their married life, unwilling to abandon the upper levels but increasingly unable to negotiate the stairs, had hacked up the back rooms and put in a tiny elevator.<br><br> Kate turned to gaze affectionately at the house. Most buyers would have been daunted by the enormous expense of ripping out the mechanism and restoring the rooms to their previous condition, but for Kate, the one-person elevator had been her personal deciding factor in its favor: Lee would never have agreed to its installation, but if it was here anyway, well, why not make use of it? The personal lift, just large enough for the wheelchair during Lee's bad times, was an unvoiced recognition that the effects of the bullet through Lee's spine, twelve years before, would never completely leave them; it had made their lives infinitely simpler.<br><br> The enormous price brought by the Russian Hill house had enabled them to make other renovations, from new carpeting and fresh paint to a complete rebuilding of the kitchen. Lee had also set up her therapy rooms in the front and was seeing clients again.<br><br> Most of all, however, what they had gained with the move was a thing that neither had known they needed: a community. They had traded socialites for Socialists, politicos for legal-aid lawyers, middle-aged white faces for a rainbow coalition of young families. Of the seven people Kate saw as she passed down the front walk that morning, she knew five of them by name, and had eaten dinner with three of those. Two doors down lived Nora's best friend, an eight-year-old girl from China, the oldest of three multiracial children adopted by a bank manager and his aromatherapist wife. Lee's long-time caregiver lived with his new family three blocks away. The woman in the big corner house had recently opened up a Montessori-style child-care facility, which meant that Nora could spend two afternoons a week with her friends. Typically, last summer the neighborhood association had voted to close the street one Sunday so everyone could hold a block party.<br><br> Small-town life in the big city.<br><br> Al's car appeared around the corner. Kate waved one last time, to the woman she sometimes went jogging with (who this morning was out running with her black Lab instead), tossed her coat and briefcase into the backseat, and hopped in beside him.<br><br> "How's the kid?" he asked before her buckle had latched.<br><br> "Perfect, as always. And yours?"<br><br> "They're all fine. Jules has a major crush, I quote, on her lab partner, Maya is thinking about a summer camp run entirely in Latin, and Daniel has discovered guns."<br><br> "Oh, Jani must be pleased about that."<br><br> "The genetic inclination of boys, I suppose, to make weapons out of anything. Sticks, Legos, organic vegetarian hot dogs."<br><br> "I know, I see it all the time at Nora's preschool."<br><br> "Still, he's also into sports--he's wants to try out for Little League next year. That's where I was, throwing balls for the second-graders."<br><br> Al was enjoying his second trip through parenting, at the same time his grandchildren were coming along. He sounded more than happy about the whole thing.<br><br> "So, speaking of boys and their guns, what's with this one up at Point Bonita?"<br><br> "Philip Gilbert, white male, fifty-three. And no guns there, not at first sight."<br><br> "But Mr. Gilbert didn't just walk up there and die?"<br><br> "There's a scalp wound, but the coroner says it doesn't look massive enough to kill him."<br><br> "Coroner? Not ME?"<br><br> "Marin caught it and declared death, the Park people didn't think they needed to call in our ME as well. Seemed to think Marin wouldn't mind transporting the body to us."<br><br> Kate looked at the side of his face, but neither needed to say it: The San Francisco ME wasn't going to be pleased with the arrangement. "So," she said, "the vic was shooting up out in the woods? Or maybe a little sex play that got rougher than he'd intended?"<br><br> "If so, he drove in wearing his pajamas, and barefoot. In January," Al added unnecessarily. "The rangers say he wasn't a park resident and he wasn't at either of the last two conferences held there. Once they have a picture they'll take it around and ask if anyone knew him, but in the meantime, like I told you, they're pretty sure he was dumped. No sign of the car DMV has registered to him, so I sent a uniform to drive past his home address, see if it's there."<br><br> "But who's got the case? And why isn't it just Marin's?"<br><br> "Interesting question. From the little I could get out of the Park investigator I talked to, they need to look at a satellite GPS to decide just what slice of the park the body's in--if it's a federal area, that's one thing; if it's found in a place that used to be owned by the state before the park was glued together, that's another. I'd say most likely it's up to the loudest voice. Which sounds like the Park Police supervisor. Who wants to give it to us."<br><br> Kate had been peripherally involved with the issue before, when it came to prosecuting in a park murder in the late nineties. The Golden Gate National Recreation Area--Ocean Beach, the Presidio, various forts, Crissy Field, and the lump of headland across the Golden Gate Bridge--was an anomaly on the face of the National Parks Service, the only national park located within the boundaries of a city. Some crimes were handled by the Park's own Criminal Investigations Branch, located in the Presidio. Others, particularly the major crimes, were given over to other law enforcement entities.<br><br> Who got jurisdiction often depended on historical definitions: A major crime taking place in areas that had been under local control before the GGNRA would be handed to the local force; if that same crime took place in a part that had been an Army base, it might well go directly to the FBI. It was a constant headache, and although cooperative statements such as the recent Interagency Agreement went far to smooth things out, in practice the work just went ahead and got done by whoever got there first. Or, as Al said, who had the loudest voice.</p><h2>Jazz Improvisation: Tonal and Rhythmic Principles</h2><p>(Music Sales America).

In this classic book on Bible study, biblical scholar E.W.Bullinger provides a handbook for discovering, understanding, and enjoying the Bible's truths.</p><p><p>In this classic introduction to your study of God&#x2019;s Word, E. W. Bullinger guides you in the adventure of open and honest study of the Scripture from within&#x2014;allowing it to speak for itself. </p> <p>He introduces twelve practical principles of interpretation that make inductive Bible study come alive! <em>How to Enjoy the Bible</em> establishes the integrity and trustworthiness of Scripture based on its own internal evidence. All believers will be encouraged by discovering how to read, study, and enjoy the sacred contents of the Bible.</p> <p><strong>E. W. Bullinger</strong> (1837-1913) was a direct descendant of the great Swiss reformer Johann H. Bullinger. An untiring scholar of the Word of God, Bullinger&#x2019;s intense studies resulted in many books which have provided immeasurable strength and encouragement to generations of believers.</p> <p>Among Bullinger&#x2019;s best-known writings are: <em>The Companion Bible, The Critical Lexicon and Concordance to the English and Greek New Testaments, Great Cloud of Witnesses in Hebrews Eleven, Number in Scripture, Word Studies on the Holy Spirit, </em>and <em>The Witness of the Stars.</em></p>E.

You want the benefits of success, influence, and prosperity, and there's nothing wrong with that. It's what God wants for you too! Promotion even comes from God, and though relative to what God has called each person to do, it is available to every born-again believer! </p> <p>But even though promotion comes from God, it isn t God who determines whether you are promoted or not. It's you. You choose to be promoted by choosing to develop an excellent spirit, and in this book, <b>Andrew Wommack</b> will show you how. </p> <p>Using examples from the lives of Daniel and his friends, and from his own life, Wommack outlines the key characteristics of an excellent spirit including identity in Christ, true humility, full obedience, endurance, and an uncompromising stand with God's word. In contrast, Wommack also explains the dangers of moral relativity and man-pleasing and how those characteristics often mire believers in a life of mediocrity and impotence. Personal talent, beauty, education and intelligence are also not what produce promotion; it is a devoted relationship with God which, in turn, produces an excellent spirit. </p> <p> No matter how much money you make or where you live; no matter who your connections are or the color of your skin; it is an excellent spirit that will be the true determiner of your promotion, and that spirit is what Wommack encourages you to pursue in <i>Excellence.</i></p></p><p><p>Andrew's life was forever changed the moment he encountered the supernatural love of God on March 23, 1968. You could say his theology was transformed overnight. Andrew went from seeing God as someone from whom he had to earn approval, to a Father who accepted him on an unconditional basis and who greatly desired fellowship with him. The author of more than thirty books, Andrew has made it his mission for nearly five decades to change the way the world sees God, by focusing on God's love and grace.</p> <p>Andrew's vision is to go as far and deep with the Gospel as possible. His message goes far through the Gospel Truth television and radio program, which is available to nearly half the world's population. Additionally, he has an extensive library of teaching materials in print, audio, and video. To date, his ministry has distributed millions of free teaching materials globally. </p> <p>The message goes deep through discipleship training, equipping, and mentoring the next generation of leaders through Charis Bible College, founded in 1994. There are currently more than seventy Charis campuses and over 6,000 students worldwide, set to carry on the same mission of changing the way the world sees God. </p> <p>What God can do through one person whose vision has been changed to see Him properly is the story of Andrew s legacy. </p></p><h2>Rocky Mountain National Park: The Complete Hiking Guide</h2><p>The complete experience of hiking Rocky Mountain National Park has finally been captured in one comprehensive volume.

But rural America&#x2014;not urban America&#x2014;is also the new center of poverty. Thus, the rural church stands at the crossroads of strength and struggle. It carries the gospel, the very hope and power needed. Yet its ministry efforts are hamstrung because urban and suburban churches often don&#x2019;t realize their need for rural churches, and the rural church itself rarely understands its unique assets and values.&nbsp;<em>The Forgotten&nbsp;Church</em>&nbsp;addresses these problems and:</p> <ul> <li>provides an overview of rural ministry</li> <li>explores opportunities recent trends provide</li> <li>showcases the remarkable benefits of suburban, urban, and rural churches working together</li> </ul> <p>This book is essential for any pastor&#x2014;whether from the city or the sticks&#x2014;because we are one body and we need each other.</p></p><p><b><p>Is the church becoming polarized too?</p></b><p>We&#x2019;d like to believe disunity is just a political problem, but division and discord infect our churches as well. The reality is that rural and urban churches typically know plenty of stereotypes about one another but have few actual relationships <i><b>with</b></i> one another.</p><p>As a result, there&#x2019;s little interaction between the two groups. Rural churches end up isolated and lack the resources they need, while urban and suburban churches miss out on the wisdom of their rural brothers and sisters.</p><p><i>The Forgotten Church</i> analyzes how we got here, how to move forward, and what we can learn from one another along the way. It will teach you the truth about rural culture and spiritual life, as well as the history, strengths, and challenges of today&#x2019;s rural church. We cannot afford to live our separate church lives anymore. It&#x2019;s time to embrace one another and work together as one body.

Whether writing elegies, meditations on aging, or an extended homage to Lucy, the earliest known hominid, the pared-down compactness of her tone and vision reveals a singular voice in American poetry. As Adrienne Rich has said of Valentine's work, "This is a poetry of the highest order, because it lets us into spaces and meanings we couldn't approach in any other way."</p><p><b>From "If a Person Visits Someone in a Dream, in Some Cultures the Dreamer Thanks Them":</b></p><p><i>At a hotel in another star.

In the connected, untitled lyrics that make up the final section of Valentine's 11th collection, the poet is at her fierce best. She addresses Lucy, an early hominid whose skeleton was discovered in Ethiopia in 1974. The details that Valentine always renders palpable and significant are heightened by their juxtaposition with this long-lost life, as when she questions: "Did you have a cup, Lucy?/ O God who transcends time,/ let Lucy have a cup." Current terrors--bodies falling from the World Trade Center towers, the deaths of a pair named Ruth and Grace--are both contextualized and underscored by this totem "skeleton mother." Valentine writes: "when my scraped-out child died Lucy/ you hold her, all the time." The rest of the volume ranges in subject matter and setting, moving from a soldier in the Civil War to a chemo patient, Haiti, ghosts in elephant fields. Each poem shares Valentine's trademark concision and pared-down punch. Some of her severe observations can stop your breath: "Don't listen to the words--/ they're only little shapes for what you're saying,/ they're only cups if you're thirsty, you aren't thirsty." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The approach of modern science is largely detached, intellectual and analytical, and it is increasingly recognized that many of our contemporary problems stem from the resulting divorce from nature. By contrast, Goethe&#39;s way of science pursued understanding through the experience of the &#39;authentic wholeness&#39; of what was observed. Working with the intuitive mode of consciousness, Goethe aimed at an encounter with the whole phenomenon in its relationship with the observer. In his way of seeing, rather than dividing merely in order to categorize, we should investigate the parts of an object in order to reveal the true nature of the whole. In this invaluable study, Henri Bortoft examines the phenomenological and cultural roots of Goethe&#39;s ways of science. He argues that Goethe&#39;s insights, far from belonging to the past, represent the foundation for a future science. This new science of nature, involving other human faculties besides the analytical mind, can provide understanding and explanation in a way which our present scientific attitudes, and the culture they serve, desperately lack.</p><p>Henri Bortoft (1938-2012) was a physicist with an interest in the history of science and continental philosophy. He also authored Taking Appearance Seriously (Floris Books, 2012).'Henri Bortoft is one of the world's foremost experts on Goethean science.' David Lorimer, Scientific &amp; Medical Network 'This is a gem of a book. Bortoft has made Goethe's thinking available in a particularly clear way.' -- David Peat, author of Blackfoot Physics 'Bortoft shows how the contemporary impulse for participatory science can be realized. What's more, the book is beautifully written.' -- Brian Goodwin, author of Nature's Due and How the Leopard Changed Its Spots</p><h2>Etta and Otto and Russell and James: A Novel</h2><p>This &#x201c;poetic, poignant&#x201d; (<i>US Weekly</i>) debut features last great adventures, unlikely heroes, and a &#x201c;sweet, disarming story of lasting love&#x201d; (<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>).<br><br>Eighty-three-year-old Etta has never seen the ocean. So early one morning she takes a rifle, some chocolate, and her best boots and begins walking the 3,232 kilometers from rural Saskatchewan, Canada eastward to the sea. As Etta walks further toward the crashing waves, the lines among memory, illusion, and reality blur.<br> <br>Otto wakes to a note left on the kitchen table. &#x201c;I will try to remember to come back,&#x201d; Etta writes to her husband. Otto has seen the ocean, having crossed the Atlantic years ago to fight in a far-away war. He understands. But with Etta gone, the memories come crowding in and Otto struggles to keep them at bay. Meanwhile, their neighbor Russell has spent his whole life trying to keep up with Otto and loving Etta from afar. Russell insists on finding Etta, wherever she&#x2019;s gone. Leaving his own farm will be the first act of defiance in his life.<br> <br>Moving from the hot and dry present of a quiet Canadian farm to a dusty, burnt past of hunger, war, and passion, from trying to remember to trying to forget, <i>Etta and Otto and Russell and James</i> is an astounding literary debut &#x201c;of deep longing, for reinvention and self-discovery, as well as for the past and for love and for the boundless unknown&#x201d; (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>). &#x201c;In this haunting debut, set in a starkly beautiful landscape, Hooper delineates the stories of Etta and the men she loved (Otto and Russell) as they intertwine through youth and wartime and into old age. It&#x2019;s a lovely book you&#x2019;ll want to linger over&#x201d; (<i>People</i>).</p><p><p><b>Q&amp;A with Caroline Leavitt and Emma Hooper</b></p> <p><strong>Photo credit: Caroline Leavitt</strong></p> <p><strong>Photo credit: Martin Tompkins </strong></p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong> I always want to know what sparked a particular book? What was the question that haunted you?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> I think the question that drove a lot of this book was &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d; Why not walk 3,000 miles? Why not go find the caribou? Why not make paper mach� animals until all the space in your yard and heart is filled up? These Why Nots are what built the story. First them, and then their partners, the just-plain whys. Okay, there&#x2019;s no reason why Etta can&#x2019;t walk all the way to the ocean one way or another, now we need to figure out why she&#x2019;d want to... It was like a persistent three year old asking why? why? why? I suppose that&#x2019;s a bit of a cheeky answer, because that&#x2019;s, I imagine, how most every story is made, but, still, in this case, that&#x2019;s what happened, my imagination said:</p> <p>Why not have a character walk across Canada?</p> <p>And my brain replied: </p> <p>No real reason why not... now tell me why she would want to...?</p> <p>And so on.</p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong> This is your debut, and it&#x2019;s an astonishing one. What was it like writing this book? What kind of writer are you? Do you make outlines? Do you have rituals? And do you already have something else you are working on?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> Writing this book was very... sporadic. I&#x2019;ve got three other jobs, as a freelance musician, an academic at Bath Spa University and a violin teacher, so the writing of this book took place in all the little gaps and spaces in between other things. Lots of writing on the train! (I&#x2019;m actually writing these answers to you on the train right now... :) ). </p> <p>I don&#x2019;t make outlines, I prefer to start each writing session having no idea what&#x2019;s going to happen next... keeps things interesting for me, and I think the spontaneity allows for a more vibrant, living story. I do have a lot of organising &#x2018;helpers&#x2019; tacked up around my desk and office though. For this book I had a big piece of paper with the names and birthdates of all of Otto&#x2019;s siblings, for example... .</p> <p>Because my writing takes places at all sorts of different times and in all sorts of different places (sound-checks for gigs are another good place to squeeze in a couple hundred words...) I don&#x2019;t have straight-forward writing rituals. (Though I&#x2019;m envious and in awe of authors who do.) I do have a few portable rituals though; listening to music is one of these. If I&#x2019;m having trouble getting my head into the writing space I&#x2019;ve got three or four musicians whose work I know puts me into the right zone; I&#x2019;ll pop on some headphones and sink into writing that way, often.</p> <p>And yes! There is something new I&#x2019;m working on... it&#x2019;s a new novel set in a tiny fishing island outpost off the coast of Newfoundland (which is itself off the eastern coast of Canada). It&#x2019;s got mermaids and sea monsters and a lot of rain in it. I&#x2019;m fairly in love with it at the moment...</p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong>I love the whole idea of the persistence of love and memory. Otto struggles remembering the war. Russell, his friend can&#x2019;t forget a particular woman. And Etta needs to see the ocean. hoping she can remember to come back. Can you talk a bit about memory and its relationship to the book, please?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> In <i>Etta and Otto and Russell and James</i> I wanted to explore memory as it pertains to and shapes our ideas of identity. Our sense of self is built out of these stories we tell ourselves about ourselves in the past, and sometimes these stories and memories can get so heavy that they stand in the way of who we want to be or could be now. Etta needs to rewrite her memories so that they are hers and not overwhelmed by Otto&#x2019;s. Russell needs to let his go so that he can move on and out and away. </p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong> Etta is 83-years-old and one of the most alive characters I&#x2019;ve read. Tell me how you went about crafting her. </p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> Well, Etta and Otto are both loosely based on my maternal grandparents. My grandpa did come from a farm family of 15 kids and his hair did go white after his trip to the World War Two front, and my grandma did teach in a tiny prairie school. Many of the recipes included are her own as well. Of course much of Etta&#x2019;s character is fiction too; I think she is who I want to be at eighty-three.</p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong> What&#x2019;s obsessing you now and why?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> Sea monsters! Both real and mythical. The giant squid is particularly fascinating; I was recently at a film festival where I got to be in a room with one of the only two people ever to have seen a live one. Ever! He said it was shining gold in colour. Amazing. I love that there are these real life magical things still being discovered and explored.</p> <p><strong>Caroline:</strong> What question didn&#x2019;t I ask that I should have?</p> <p><strong>Emma:</strong> Hm... lots of people ask: &#x201c;what actually happened at the end of <i>Etta and Otto and Russell and James</i>.&#x201d; But I believe pretty strongly in Barthes&#x2019; idea of the death of the author (as in, interpretation is the key to truth in art, not authority authority), so I wouldn&#x2019;t have answered anyway. So I guess that&#x2019;s the question I&#x2019;m glad you didn&#x2019;t ask... </p> <p>As for what you should have... maybe what&#x2019;s for lunch? Because I think that&#x2019;s an excellent question and I do not know the answer, but wish I did...</p>Raised in Alberta, Canada, Emma Hooper brought her love of music and literature to the UK, where she received a doctorate in Musico-Literary studies at the University of East-Anglia and currently lectures at Bath Spa University.

Then a reporter with the <i>Detroit Free Press</i>, Benjaminson interviewed Ballard a year before her death in 1976 and elicited a sad story of a starry-eyed, single-minded high school dropout whose dream, and fortune, was co-opted by Berry Gordy's Motown empire. Growing up together in Detroit's black working-class Brewster Projects, gospel-singing Ballard and Mary Wilson first formed the Primettes, joined by Diane (as she was then known) Ross and Betty McGlown, who eventually dropped out. In 1961, the teenagers auditioned for Berry Gordy, who kept them doing backup as they matured, touring with the Motortown Review across country by bus until the newly configured Supremes (Ballard chose the name) had their first hit in 1964 with Where Did Our Love Go? The boom-boom beat coupled with the nasaly sound of Ross's voice prompted Gordy to promote Ross rather than Ballard as lead. Over the Supremes' several heady years in the spotlight, Benjaminson explains in this engaging biography, gobs of money vanished through flimsy contracts and the fingers of unscrupulous managers, costly clothes and glamorous acquaintances, and Ballard's resentment of Ross's ambition and Gordy's manipulation got her fired. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Her story has inspired Toni Morrison&#x2019;s <i>Beloved,</i> a film based on the novel starring Oprah Winfrey, and an opera. Yet, her life has defied solid historical treatment. In <i>Driven toward Madness,</i> Nikki M. Taylor brilliantly captures her circumstances and her transformation from a murdering mother to an icon of tragedy and resistance.<br><br>Taylor, the first African American woman to write a history of Garner, grounds her approach in black feminist theory. She melds history with trauma studies to account for shortcomings in the written record. In so doing, she rejects distortions and fictionalized images; probes slavery&#x2019;s legacies of sexual and physical violence and psychic trauma in new ways; and finally fleshes out a figure who had been rendered an apparition.</p></p><p><p><b>Nikki M. Taylor</b> is a professor of African American history at Howard University. Her other books include <i>Frontiers of Freedom: Cincinnati&#x2019;s Black Community, 1802&#x2013;1868</i> and <i>America&#x2019;s First Black Socialist: The Radical Life of Peter H. Clark.</i></p>&#x201c;Taylor crafts a book that should be read by all who have an interest in understanding the roots of slavery and oppression of women during the pre&#x2013;Civil War era. It should also be read by those seeking to understand the depth of pain and depravity faced by women living under the tyranny of American slavery.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Library Journal</i> (starred review)<br><br>&#x201c;In this brief book, Taylor sets the context, reviews the known actions, and applies a genuinely multidisciplinary set of tools to understand a mother maybe driven to madness. The author peels away layers of analysis of Garner as archfiend or feminist and abolitionist hero to discover what she calls an intensely personal act, even if one fraught with political consequences. Summing Up: Recommended.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>CHOICE</i><br><br>&#x201c;Taylor&#x2019;s book is a must-read for anyone interested in African American history, women&#x2019;shistory, midwestern history, or Black feminist theory.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>International Journal of Africana Studies</i><br><br>&#x201c;[Taylor] uses exhaustive research to provide a nuanced view not only of Garner and her fateful act but also of the broader psychosis and trauma that slavery unleashed upon women. ... <i>Driven toward Madness</i> offers a compelling and heart-wrenching window onto the horrors faced by enslaved women in the United States.&#x201d;&#x2014;Troy Jackson, <i>Journal of American History</i><br><br>&#x201c;Taylor vividly portrays the sufferings Garner and her family endured under slavery and in their attempt to escape from it, placing their experiences in the wider context of the antebellum Midwest....

Most first time tasters are surprised at how savory acorns are. Suellen Ocean has explored acorns as food since 1979. Try her Acorn Cheesecake or her Acorn Enchiladas and rediscover what shouldn't have been lost. Here's what the critics say about "Acorns and Eat'em": "great recipes and stories... a milestone book," "quality information... edible plant knowledge," "Ocean ... is an excellent vegetarian cook," "... a veritable Betty Crocker of the woodland..." "... the leading expert in the field," "plenty of recipes... modern preparation tips... a very useful book," "the only complete acorn recipe book I know of," "Everyone who tries the acorn cookies pronounces them Delicious!&#x201d; "An extremely important book..."</p><p>Back in the late 1970&#39;s, I wanted to &#34;live off the land.&#34; I looked around and except for dried blackberries; there was not much to eat. I began wondering what the Native Americans ate. I went to the library and brought home books but except for saying that acorns were leached in water, I did not know how to prepare them. I took a pillowcase and collected hundreds of acorns, came home and ground them up in an old-fashioned meat grinder (today I use a blender) then leached them in buckets. I had no idea how long they needed to leach but judging by the stomachaches, I knew I had not yet found that out. Through trial and error, I learned to correctly leach and cook with acorns. For several years, I saved all my ideas, tips and recipes, then compiled them, along with a field guide, and came up with the book, &#34;Acorns and Eat&#39;em.&#34; Acorns are a wonderful addition to anything you prepare; I have found them to be an excellent flavor enhancer. If you&#39;ve got access to acorns, I suggest you give my recipes a try, just make sure that you leave enough acorns on the ground for wildlife, for some, their life depends on it.Ever wonder what acorns taste like? Confused because people have told you that acorns are poisonous? In this book, &#34;Acorns and Eat&#39;em,&#34; author Suellen Ocean will show you exactly how to collect, leach, store and cook with acorns. There are a wide variety of recipes, everything from breakfast, lunch and dinner to unusual deserts. For historians, there are many Native-American names for acorns and their parent oak tree and for those who truly love the out-of-doors, there is a field guide to oaks with descriptions and pictures showing what the acorns look like. If you think acorns are just for the squirrels and birds, you haven&#39;t read, &#34;Acorns and Eat&#39;em.&#34;</p><h2>Using the Enneagram in Prayer: A Contemplative Guide</h2><p>Suzanne Zuercher, an authority on the Enneagram, a system of spiritual psychology based on personality types, explores the best way for people of each Enneagram to pray. <p> Reflecting on a number of different prayer practices from the perspective of each triad, Zuercher explores how the Enneagram can help develop a contemplative attitude toward life.

From this woman I called my wife. Five hundred or more burned and blackened corpses had been pulled out of the smoking rubble of the Wheels after we bombed it into Hell, that Godsday afternoon.</p><p>I still hadn&#x2019;t forgiven her for that.</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t forgiven myself.</p><p>That was six months past now, and Ellinburg was in the grip of a summer heat. The river stank even worse than usual, but still the people of Dock Road came out to watch us pass. We were on horseback, Jochan and Bloody Anne and Fat Luka and me, and everyone had come out onto the streets to see us. We were the Pious Men, and in Ellinburg we were received like princes.</p><p>Six months ago the Wheels had been a wasteland of devastation. On my wedding day Ailsa&#x2019;s company of army sappers had all but destroyed the district with enough blasting powder to start a war. Or perhaps, as I hoped, to prevent one.</p><p>The butcher&#x2019;s bill had been horrific, and to my mind that bill was laid squarely at Ailsa&#x2019;s door.</p><p>If we cannot stop this infiltration there will be another war, and we will lose. There will be another Abingon, right here in our own country.</p><p>Ailsa had told me that, and she had swayed me to her cause and to the service of the Queen&#x2019;s Men with those words. With those words, and with threats. It was that or hang, I knew that, but when I thought of how the streets had looked the day after our wedding I couldn&#x2019;t help but feel that Ailsa had brought Abingon to the Wheels herself, in the service of the crown.</p><p>My wife had done that, this murderous stranger I was forced to share a house with. To share a life with, whether I liked it or not. It was that or hang, and that was no choice at all. That was what the Queen&#x2019;s Men could do.</p><p>I had vowed then to rebuild, and I had done that.</p><p>Dock Road ran through the heart of the Wheels, and a year ago it would have been unthinkable for me to be there. The Wheels belonged to the Gutcutters, everyone knew that, but on my wedding day all that had changed. The Wheels was mine now, and the docks too. All of eastern Ellinburg belonged to the Pious Men, and that was good. It was good, and business had never been better, but it was still a long way from being safe.</p><p>&#x201c;I can see two faces that shouldn&#x2019;t be here,&#x201d; Bloody Anne said quietly, her voice raspy from years of shouting orders and the smoke of blasting powder. &#x201c;The top of Fellmonger&#x2019;s Alley, you see them?&#x201d;</p><p>I glanced casually that way as I waved to a shopkeeper I recognized. He was behind on his payments, that one, and from the look on his face I could see that he knew it. No one fell behind with their payments on my streets, not if they knew what was good for them. I was the new boss of the Wheels, and I needed everybody there to understand that.</p><p>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I see them, Bloody Anne.&#x201d;</p><p>One of them was a resin smoker and petty thief who I had kicked out of the Stink a year ago. The other I knew worked for Bloodhands. I had to force myself not to shudder when I thought of that name. He called himself Klaus Vhent in public these days, but he was Bloodhands and he was a nasty piece of work and no mistake. He had been Ma Aditi&#x2019;s second in the Gutcutters, but I knew he was more than that.</p><p>Much more.</p><p>The Gutcutters had been wiped out on my wedding day, but the Skanians very much hadn&#x2019;t and more to the point neither had Bloodhands. That man who had called himself Ma Aditi&#x2019;s second in the Gutcutters was the Skanians&#x2019; head man in Ellinburg. He was something like a Queen&#x2019;s Man himself back in Skania, far across the sea to the north, or at least he was working directly for someone who was. Worse than that, I knew he had the ear of the governor. He was a man who ruled his gang through simple fear, a man who commanded the loyalty of his men by holding a knife to the throats of their hostage children.</p><p>We might be done fighting, but that didn&#x2019;t mean we could afford to grow complacent.</p><p>I let my hands fall to the hilts of the Weeping Women as they hung heavy at my belt. They were a pair of beautifully crafted shortswords that I had looted from a dead colonel after the last battle of Abingon. I had named them Remorse and Mercy, and thinking about Bloodhands had made me very much want to stab someone with them.</p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t do that, though, not here. Not in front of people, not anymore I couldn&#x2019;t. I was a prince in Ellinburg, and princes have men who do that sort of thing for them. I shot Fat Luka a look.</p><p>He nodded and let his horse slow until he was riding behind the rest of us. He was still no horseman, but he was getting better at it. More to the point, he knew where Cutter was in the crowd, which was more than I did.</p><p>The man could be virtually invisible, when he wanted to be, but I knew Cutter was following us on foot. He was an unremarkable-looking fellow with a little less than forty years to him, lean and wiry and bearded like so many working men in the Wheels and the Stink. He was just another face in the crowd in his nondescript laborer&#x2019;s clothes.</p><p>Cutter was my brother Jochan&#x2019;s man, not mine; I still had no idea where Cutter had come from or what levers moved him. He had certain skills, though, skills I knew he hadn&#x2019;t learned in the army.</p><p>Luka rode up beside me again, and I looked at him and he gave me a short nod. That was done then, and there was no need to spare it another thought. Those two faces wouldn&#x2019;t be seen in the Wheels again. Or anywhere else, for that matter. That would make Bloodhands think twice about trying to spy on me on my own streets.</p><p>The spies aside, our ride out went well enough. The Wheels was mostly on its way to being rebuilt by then, and many of the factories were back in operation. Those factories paid their taxes to me now, not to the Gutcutters, as did every business on Dock Road. That was good. I had never thought to see the day when the Pious Men controlled so much territory. I was rich, richer than I&#x2019;d ever been, and one of the most powerful men in Ellinburg. Those things pleased me a great deal.</p><p>Every business in the Wheels had paid their protection money to Ma Aditi for years, of course they had, but come my wedding day she hadn&#x2019;t been able to protect them at all. She had been too busy having her head cut off. That had been Cutter&#x2019;s work too. Afterward, when the Pious Men came calling, with coin to rebuild and promises of a better future, those businesses had fallen into my lap like so much ripe fruit.</p><p>Oh, how Governor Hauer hated that.</p><p>&#x201c;Good turnout,&#x201d; Bloody Anne observed.</p><p>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; I said, and I was unable to stop a smile of satisfaction from crossing my face. &#x201c;It is.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Everyone loves you, Tomas,&#x201d; my brother Jochan said, but there was something in his tone that made me give him a look.</p><p>He resented me, I knew that well enough, and more than that he resented Anne&#x2019;s place at my right hand. He still thought he should have been my second, for all that he was fundamentally unsuitable for the role.</p><p>&#x201c;That they do,&#x201d; I said softly. &#x201c;That they do.&#x201d;</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t wanted to return home afterward, but then I usually didn&#x2019;t. Ailsa would be at home, after all, and I was in too good a mood to want to spoil it by seeing her. I went back to the Tanner&#x2019;s Arms with Anne and Luka instead. I would take the company of people I knew I could trust over that of a Queen&#x2019;s Man any day of the week. I didn&#x2019;t know where Jochan went; he just said he had something to do, and he gave his horse to Luka and headed off on his own. He should have had a bodyguard with him, of course, but Jochan hated that. I suspected that the thing he had to do was get blind drunk and start a fight. It usually was.</p><p>Still, we were back in the heart of the Stink by then, the original Pious Men streets, and I knew he wouldn&#x2019;t come to any harm. Someone else probably would, before the night was out, and tomorrow it would cost me silver to make it right with them. That happened too often these days, but Jochan was Jochan.</p><p>Cookpot met us in the stable yard and took the horses, a smile lighting up his round, sweaty face as he stroked my black mare&#x2019;s nose. Cookpot had been a soldier once, and a Pious Man for a little while, but life as a groom suited him better. He was hurt in the mind, where it doesn&#x2019;t show, hurt by the things he had seen and done, but the horses brought him some peace. I felt like I had owed him that much, at least, after what I had put him through.</p><p>The three of us went into the Tanner&#x2019;s through the back. Hari was behind the bar, still leaning on his stick but a lot stronger than he had been six months ago after he had taken the terrible wound that had nearly killed him. Black Billy was on the door, his heavy club hanging from his belt and his shirtsleeves rolled up to display dark-skinned arms that were almost as thick around as my legs. He grinned at me as we came in, and I gave him a nod across the crowded common room. Borys was there too, I noticed, playing dice with Mika. Borys was an older man, thoughtful and trustworthy, while Mika had a sharp intelligence to him that you&#x2019;d never have guessed from looking at him.</p><p>They were good lads, all of them. They were my Pious Men, but before that we had been in the army together. We had fought together in Messia and then in the Hell that had been Abingon, and we had fought together again to reclaim my streets here in Ellinburg. I would have trusted any man of them with my life.</p><p>Hari lined up brandies on the bar for us, and Luka took his and went to talk with Mika and Borys. I picked up my glass and the bottle both. Bloody Anne and me took my usual table in the corner, the one no one else ever sat at, however busy the tavern was. Simple Sam saw to that, and he came and stood there now with his back to us and his thickly muscled arms folded in front of his barrel chest to say that we weren&#x2019;t to be disturbed. He was a slow lad but a faithful one, and the sheer size of him brooked no arguments.</p><p>&#x201c;Did you see the bodies?&#x201d; Anne asked me. &#x201c;On our way back, I mean.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded, and smiled with grim satisfaction. The two men had been sprawled at the end of Fellmonger&#x2019;s Alley with their throats slit and their blood sprayed up the wall behind them. That was what happened to spies, on my streets anyway. That would send a message to Bloodhands all right, and that message was a simple one.</p><p>Stay off my streets, you cunt.</p><p>I wondered if they had even seen him coming.</p><p>Cutter would be back at Slaughterhouse Narrow by now, at the boardinghouse he ran in my name. That place was nothing special, a cheap and run-down flophouse for traveling slaughtermen and the skinners and laborers who followed them, but he seemed to like it there well enough.</p><p>&#x201c;What do you make of Cutter?&#x201d; I asked Anne.</p><p>&#x201c;Can I be honest with you about this?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re my second and my best friend, Bloody Anne,&#x201d; I said, and I smiled at her. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to think you can be honest with me about anything.&#x201d;</p><p>She sucked her teeth for a moment, the long scar on her face puckering and drawing the corner of her mouth down into a twisted half-scowl.</p><p>&#x201c;He gives me the fear,&#x201d; she admitted at last. &#x201c;I know he&#x2019;s part of our crew, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>She took a swallow of her brandy.</p><p>&#x201c;Go on,&#x201d; I said, after a moment. &#x201c;Say what&#x2019;s on your mind, I won&#x2019;t take it ill.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But he&#x2019;s not, is he?&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s your brother&#x2019;s man, and that&#x2019;s all he is. It&#x2019;s been a year and more and still he don&#x2019;t mix with the others. He doesn&#x2019;t go to Chandler&#x2019;s Narrow and he&#x2019;s never in here. He doesn&#x2019;t talk or joke or gamble or rough about like soldiers do. I know we aren&#x2019;t soldiers anymore, not exactly, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. you know what I mean, Tomas. No one even knows where he&#x2019;s from, or what he likes to do, or anything. The man hardly seems human.&#x201d;</p><p>I nodded slowly.</p><p>&#x201c;Aye,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s been a Pious Man for over a year, and he&#x2019;s made no friends among the crew. Has anyone tried to befriend him?&#x201d;</p><p>Anne frowned at that, as though the thought hadn&#x2019;t occurred to her.</p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; she said at last. &#x201c;Truth be told, I doubt it. He&#x2019;s not what you&#x2019;d call likable.&#x201d;</p><p>He wasn&#x2019;t, at that.</p><p>&#x201c;Aye, well,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Perhaps you might put it about that someone should try.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So long as it doesn&#x2019;t have to be me,&#x201d; Anne muttered.</p><p>I laughed and refilled our glasses.</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t do that to you,&#x201d; I said, but I could see that she meant it.</p><p>There was something about Cutter that would make anyone uneasy, and I didn&#x2019;t like not knowing what it was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Chapter 2</p><p>I had to go home eventually. I rode, with Desh and Emil and Bernd as bodyguards. They were new lads, and while Emil was a veteran from some other regiment the other two had been too young to be conscripted. None of them were Pious Men yet, but they were working out well enough. Desh especially showed promise. He was a young Alarian lad from Hull Patcher&#x2019;s Row who seemed prepared to do almost anything to earn a place at my table. That was the sort of man I wanted.</p><p>I let myself into my great house off Trader&#x2019;s Row, startling the footman who had obviously been dozing in his chair in the hall. Stefan was there too, but he definitely hadn&#x2019;t been asleep.</p><p>He lowered the crossbow he was holding and gave me a nod when I stepped into the hall.</p><p>&#x201c;Evening, boss,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>He was a solid man, was Stefan, if an unimaginative one. He was a soldier right down to his bones and no mistake.</p><p>&#x201c;All quiet?&#x201d; I asked him.</p><p>He inspected the mechanism of his bow for a moment, not meeting my eyes.</p><p>&#x201c;No one&#x2019;s bothered the house,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>I sighed.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s still up, then?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Aye, boss.&#x201d;</p><p>That wasn&#x2019;t what I wanted to hear. It was late by then, well after midnight, and I had hoped Ailsa would have retired for the night by the time I got back. It seemed I was going to be disappointed about that.</p><p>Ailsa. My wife.</p><p>I nodded, and opened the parlor door. She called it the drawing room, and I knew I was supposed to do the same, but to my mind a parlor was a parlor however many chairs it held. I still hadn&#x2019;t discovered why she called it that, nor learned to draw either.</p><p>She was sitting by the fire with a lamp burning on the low table beside her chair and her embroidery hoop in her hands. Her smoothly powdered face remained expressionless until I had closed the door behind me.</p><p>&#x201c;Where in the gods&#x2019; names have you been?&#x201d; she demanded.</p><p>&#x201c;Good evening, my love,&#x201d; I said, and I couldn&#x2019;t keep the sarcasm out of my voice.</p><p>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t try my patience, Tomas.&#x201d;</p><p>I poured myself a brandy from one of the bottles on the side table and turned to face her with the heavy crystal glass in my hand.</p><p>&#x201c;I told you we were riding out into the Wheels today,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We did that, and then I went to the Tanner&#x2019;s for a drink.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your place is here,&#x201d; she snapped.</p><p>&#x201c;And my friends are there.&#x201d;</p><p>Ailsa put down her embroidery and glared at me.</p><p>&#x201c;Sit down,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;and I will try to explain this to you one more time.

For some it is the day they get married or have a child. For others it comes when they finally reach a sought-after goal. My life, however, drastically changed course the day my parents sold me into slavery. I was eight years old.<br> <br>Before that fateful day I was a normal child in a large family in a small town near Alexandria, Egypt. Growing up in a poor neighborhood in Egypt is nothing like life for kids in America. Like many who lived in the community I was raised in, our family was quite poor. I was the seventh of eleven children, many of whom were much older, and to this day I can&#x2019;t recall the names of all of my brothers and sisters.<br> <br>We moved many times when I was a child, but the last home I lived in with my family was our downtown second-story apartment. It was tiny, just two rooms that we shared with two other families, and there was not room during the day for everyone to be inside. At night our family slept together in a single room, and the two other families shared the second room. Our family slept on blankets on the floor, as we weren&#x2019;t rich enough to have beds. There was one bathroom for everyone&#x2014;including the people who lived in the other three units in the building.<br> <br>I know my parents were happy once&#x2014;I had seen photos of them laughing on the beach, and with their arms around each other, photos taken in the first years of their marriage. The parents I knew, though, didn&#x2019;t speak to each other. Instead, they yelled. And I never once saw them hold hands or embrace.<br> <br>My dad worked in residential construction, possibly as a bricklayer, but he was often absent from our home for weeks at a time. When Dad did show up, he acted in a way that I now know is abusive. He was a loud, angry, belligerent, unreasonable man who beat us whenever he was displeased, which was often. My father eventually spent more and more time at his mother&#x2019;s, but this was not necessarily a bad thing, as life was calmer when he was not around.<br> <br>Even though Dad beat us, there were good times with him too. A number of times he held me in his arms and told me how lucky he was to have me. It was during those times that I felt completely loved, and my own love for my dad would be strong.<br> <br>But then he&#x2019;d flaunt other women in front of us, and in front of my mother. Outside we&#x2019;d see him flirting with women. Even as young as I was, I knew instinctively that was wrong. Plus, I could see the grim line of my mother&#x2019;s mouth and the sadness in her eyes. Unfortunately, in our neighborhood there were any number of women who thought nothing of spending private time with another woman&#x2019;s husband. Most of the men I saw acted just as my dad did. It is sad to me that that kind of behavior was accepted.<br> <br>Every time my dad came home, I hoped he would be different, but he never was. I hated waking up in the morning to hear my parents fighting, and that&#x2019;s why I was never too unhappy when he left to go back to his mother&#x2019;s house.<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t like my father&#x2019;s mother, because she was as mean and bitter as he was. I did not know the rest of his family well enough to know if they were like that too. His family members did not like my mother and rarely came to see us. On the rare occasion when we visited his mother&#x2019;s home, my grandmother asked him in front of us about other women that he spent time with, and she made it a point to tell us how awful our mother was, even when our mother was present. I never understood that, because my mother was our rock. She was the backbone of our family and was the person who made sure we had what few clothes and food that we did have.<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know why my mother married my dad. Neither of their families approved of the match, but in the early years they had a good life near my mother&#x2019;s family in Alexandria. They had a nice home, four children, and were in love. Then an earthquake hit, and everything they had was reduced to rubble.<br> <br>My mom and dad did not have the mental strength to move on from that level of disaster, for they never got their lives back together after that. Life began to spiral downward, and by the time I came along on September 29, 1989, my family was living in poverty in a slum.<br> <br>When I was young, my mother was constantly sick, tired, and pregnant. I was later diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), when I was in my teens, and I think my mother may have had it too, because genetics play a big part in who ends up with RA.<br> <br>Rheumatoid arthritis is a long-term autoimmune disease that causes inflammation of the joints and surrounding tissues. Wrists, fingers, knees, feet, and ankles are most commonly affected, but RA can affect organs, too. The disease begins slowly, usually with minor joint pain, stiffness, and fatigue. Morning stiffness is common, and joints may feel warm, tender, and stiff when not used for a while. It is not an easy disease to live with, and it must have been even harder for my mother, who had few resources and who had to care for her many children.<br> <br>In Egypt many children do not go to school. It is legal there for children to stop school and begin work when they are fourteen years old. Only families that need money force their children to begin working at that age, but the families that struggle the most don&#x2019;t send their kids to school at all. We were one of those families. I never went to school and never learned to read or write. (I did both much later in life, after I was freed.) I had four younger siblings, and my role in the family was to care for them while my parents worked.<br> <br>To my knowledge only one of my sisters ever attended school. She was the fourth child in our family, and my mother&#x2019;s parents were raising her. Except during holidays, I never saw her. This sister led a completely different life from the rest of us. She even went to college, which was unheard of for people of our status in Egypt. I am not sure why this sister lived with our grandparents, but it might be because she was the youngest of my parents&#x2019; four children when the earthquake hit. Maybe my grandparents offered to take her temporarily to help out while my parents got back on their feet, and it turned into a more permanent arrangement.<br> <br>The two oldest of my siblings were twin girls. One twin left early on to get married, and I never saw much of her after that. It was as if she&#x2019;d jumped at her first opportunity to escape our family. The other twin, Zahra, was the wild child in our family. She was always getting into trouble, which may have been why my parents sent her to work for a wealthy family who lived several hours away.<br> <br>When it came to my brothers, I&#x2019;m not sure what they did. I know that some of my older brothers went to school, because they got up every morning, gathered their books, and walked to the school that was not too far from our house. At least I think that&#x2019;s what they did most days. Other days they could have had jobs or have been carousing on a street corner somewhere. I wish I had thought to ask my brothers to teach me to read and write, but for whatever reason, that thought never came into my head.<br> <br>My oldest brother, Hassan, was born between the twins and the sister who lived with our grandparents, and I know his name because it was the surname that I was born with. I was born Shyima El-Sayed Hassan, and my brother was Hassan Hassan. &#x201c;El-Sayed&#x201d; was my mother&#x2019;s maiden name, and it was common practice in Egypt then to use the mother&#x2019;s maiden name as a child&#x2019;s middle name. I am sorry to say that while I can guess, I am not 100 percent sure about the names of my other siblings.<br> <br>I do know that the two siblings who came between the sister who lived with our grandparents and me were boys. They were my brothers, but I didn&#x2019;t like them much. I was too young to know much about Hassan, but these two boys were turning out to be much like our father. They were rude, loud, and demanding, but what I recall most about them was that when they paid any attention to me, the attention consisted of inappropriate touching.<br> <br>No one had ever talked to me about not letting others touch my private parts. In fact, I wasn&#x2019;t even sure it was wrong when my brothers did. I am not sure when it started, maybe when I was around five or six. The touches made me feel bad inside, and I avoided the boys whenever I could. I never knew if my mother knew what the boys were doing, but I think that she didn&#x2019;t. I didn&#x2019;t tell her, because I didn&#x2019;t know it was wrong. Familial relationships were murky to me, and I didn&#x2019;t know anything about appropriate boundaries.<br> <br>Since then I have wondered if, after I left, they touched any of my younger sisters as they had me. My older sisters were old enough&#x2014;and not around enough&#x2014;to not let them get away with that. At least I hope that is the case. But that is the thing about abusers: They choose vulnerable people.<br> <br>There was a time, however, when one of my brothers saved me. I was about seven, and we had been playing on some hay bales that were stacked near our apartment. I didn&#x2019;t have any shoes on, and when I jumped off the stack of hay onto the ground, I landed on the edge of a sheet of glass and cut off all the toes on my right foot. I must have been in shock; I didn&#x2019;t even notice until another kid said, &#x201c;Hey, what happened to your foot?&#x201d; There was little blood at that point. Sometimes when amputations occur there is so much shock to the body that the body draws blood away from the area for a time. Apparently that is what happened to me.<br> <br>One of the oddest things about this story is that I was not freaked out. After the accident I went around and picked up my toes. Then a neighbor kid grabbed me and carried me to my brother, who put me in a litter-type carrier. A litter is a large fabric sling that has long poles attached to the sides that extend in front of and behind the sling. Two people, one in front and one behind, stand between the poles and pick them up. Then the people carry the litter as they run to a destination. This was a common type of transportation in our town.<br> <br>Nothing hurt until the people carrying the litter began to head to the hospital. Then the blood started to flow and I became petrified with fear and pain. The only things I recall of the hospital itself are the bed I lay on and that the bed was in an enclosed room, rather than being in the open. But the surgery to reattach my toes stays in my mind, as they did it without any anesthesia. You can imagine how painful that was! A nurse held my squirming body down as the doctors worked on my foot. Their faces were masked, which meant all I could see of them was the concern in their eyes.<br> <br>I was terrified that I would die. The pain of the procedure was far greater than anything I had ever experienced, and after, when I saw the scary amount of my blood on the surgical towels that had been used during the operation, I thought I might faint.<br> <br>Right after the operation I went home, although I am not sure how I got there. Then I stayed off my foot for a long time. When I started walking again, my dad said, &#x201c;Do you want to lose your toes again? They are not healed. Sit down.&#x201d; That his words have stuck in my head must mean that he was home for part of that time. I know that my mom changed the wrap on my foot several times. I must have gone back to a doctor to get the stitches removed, but I do not remember any of that. Today I have all of my toes, but only two of them work normally&#x2014;my big toe and the toe next to it.<br> <br>My life in Egypt was like that&#x2014;simple happiness interrupted by unimaginable tragedy. It was an unsafe world. But it was my home.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>While I never connected with my older brothers and sisters, I adored my younger siblings. Closest in age to me was a boy, then a girl and another boy, then my baby sister. When the first three of my four younger siblings were born, a midwife came, and the rest of us were sent out of the one room we lived in. But my youngest sister came into this world on a day when my mother and I were in our apartment while the rest of our family had gone to visit relatives to celebrate a holiday. When my youngest sister was born, my mother lay on a blanket while I guided the baby&#x2019;s head out. My mother instructed me to pull the head, but not too hard. I think my attachment to this younger sister was strong because I was there during her birth.<br> <br>After my sister was born, my mom said, &#x201c;Go down to the neighbors, and one of the women there will come to help.&#x201d; That was a big thing, because most of the people in our neighborhood were mean to my mother. I think between my mother&#x2019;s unsuccessfully trying to correct my brothers&#x2019; behavior and having eleven children, other people looked down on her. And, as she behaved with my dad, my mother never stood up for herself with the neighbors. Instead she just took their verbal abuse. She forgave people all the time and often said, &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t stay mad at people.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hated that my mother allowed others to treat her poorly, and I wondered if she allowed people to steamroll her at work, too. My mother never said much, and when she did, she was soft-spoken. It was not in her nature to be mean. Instead she took the negative behavior people dished out to her.<br> <br>As for my older brothers and sisters, they were away from our home for long periods of time. My mother might have been in contact with them when they were gone, but if so, she never mentioned it to me. I might not see a family member for months (or years), and then one day, poof, there they were. When I got to see my older sisters on holidays, especially the sister who was being raised by my grandparents, I was glad to see they were stronger women than my mother was. Holidays were about the only days I got to interact with my older sisters, and I paid close attention to what they said and did. I hoped that someday I could find that kind of strength for myself. Little did I know that I would need it sooner rather than later.<br> <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�<br> <br>Though my family moved many times, each place we lived in was much the same. Each home was in a run-down two- or three-story apartment building in the middle of town, with anywhere from four to twelve units in the building. Once, we were kicked out of an apartment in the middle of the night for failure to pay rent.<br> <br>&#x201c;Gather your things,&#x201d; my mother said, and we did. There wasn&#x2019;t much. That night my mother, my two older brothers, all of my younger siblings, and I slept in the street because we had no car and nowhere to go. The next day we walked what seemed like forever until we got to another apartment that was much like the last.<br> <br>I can look back now and see how hard that must have been on my mother. With the continual pregnancies&#x2014;close to a dozen children&#x2014;and her being ill, the many moves added to the stress of her life. My mother was well spoken, and I believe that she was an educated woman. I know that she had a job, but if I ever knew what she did, I have long forgotten.<br> <br>One day my mother tried to enroll me in school. I must have been no more than seven years old at the time. I don&#x2019;t know what motivated her to do that, but I was excited about the possibility. My older sister who lived with my grandparents went to school, and she was smart. I wanted to be just like her. But, when we got to the school, we were told that I was too old. Too old? How can seven be too old to go to school? It may have been that there was no room at that particular school, or that it was during the middle of the school year and they didn&#x2019;t want to add a new student right then, but the result w...</p><h2>Theatetus (Penguin Classics)</h2><p>Set immediately prior to the trial and execution of Socrates in 399 BC, Theaetetus shows the great philosopher considering the nature of knowledge itself, in a debate with the geometrician Theodorus and his young follower Theaetetus. Their dialogue covers many questions, such as: is knowledge purely subjective, composed of the ever-changing flow of impressions we receive from the outside world? Is it better thought of as "true belief"? Or is it, as many modern philosophers argue, "justified true belief," in which the belief is supported by argument or evidence? With skill and eloquence, Socrates guides the debate, drawing out the implications of these theories and subjecting them to merciless and mesmerising criticism. One of the founding works of epistemology, this profound discussion of the problem of knowledge continues to intrigue and inspire.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

M. Barrie told to five brothers -- three of whom were named Peter, John, and Michael. Peter Pan is considered one of the greatest children&#39;s stories of all time and continues to charm readers one hundred years after its first appearance as a play in 1904.</p><p>"All children, except one, grow up." Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

Perhaps no Indian ever saw so much of American expansion or fought harder to prevent that expansion from driving his people to exile and death.He knew Zebulon Pike, William Clark, Henry Schoolcraft, George Catlin, Winfield Scott, and such figures in American government as President Andrew Jackson and Secretary of State Lewis Cass. He knew Chicago when it was a cluster of log houses around a fort, and he was in St. Louis the day the American flag went up and the French flag came down.He saw crowds gather to cheer him in Philadelphia, Baltimore, and New York - and to stone the driver of his carriage in Albany - during a fantastic tour sponsored by the government.And at last he dies in 1838, bitter in the knowledge that he had led men, women, and children of his tribe to slaughter on the banks of the Mississippi.After his capture at the end of the Black Hawk War, he was imprisoned for a time and then released to live in the territory that is now Iowa. He dictated his autobiography to a government interpreter, Antoine LeClaire, and the story was put into written form by J. B. Patterson, a young Illinois newspaperman. Since its first appearance in 1833, the autobiography has become known as an American classic.</p><p><p>&nbsp;</p><b>Black Hawk</b> is one of the thirty-five Illinois authors honored by having his name cast in stone in the Illinois State Library Building, which opened in 1990.

In <i>Baudelaire's Folly</i>, Calasso turns his attention to the poets and writers of Paris in the nineteenth century who created what was later called 'the Modern.' His protagonist is Charles Baudelaire: poet of nerves, art lover, pioneering critic, man about Paris, whose groundbreaking works on modern culture described the ephemeral, fleeting nature of life in the metropolis - and the artist's role in capturing this - as no other writer had done. </p><p>With Baudelaire's critical intelligence as his inspiration, Calasso ranges through his life and work, focusing on two painters - Ingres and Delacroix - about whom Baudelaire wrote acutely, and then turns to Degas and Manet, who followed in the tracks Baudelaire laid down in his great essay <i>The Painter of Modern Life</i>. In a mosaic of stories, insights, dreams, close readings of poems and commentaries on paintings, Paris in Baudelaire's years comes to life. In the eighteenth century, a 'folie' was a garden pavilion set aside for people of leisure, a place of delight and fantasy. Here Calasso has created a brilliant and dramatic 'Folie Baudelaire': a place where the reader can encounter Baudelaire, his peers, his city, his extraordinary likes and dislikes, and his world, finally discovering that it is nothing less than the land of 'absolute literature'.</p><p>Born in Florence, Roberto Calasso lives in Milan, where he is publisher of Adelphi. He is the author of <i>Tiepolo Pink, The Ruin of Kasch</i>, <i>The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</i>, winner of the Prix Veillon and the Prix du Meilleur Livre Etranger, <i>Literature and the Gods</i>, <i>Ka</i> and <i>K</i>.</p></p><p><b>Roberto Calasso</b>, the publisher of Adelphi in Milan, is the author of many books, among them <i>The Ruin of Kasch</i>, <i>The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony</i>, <i>Ka</i>, <i>K.</i>, and <i>Tiepolo Pink</i>, all parts of a work in progress of which <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is the sixth panel. <b>Alastair McEwen</b> has translated almost ninety books of fiction and nonfiction and seven feature filmscripts, as well as radio-play adaptations, opera librettos, and many hundreds of articles for various magazines and newspapers. He has also translated some of Italy's finest writers (Calasso, Eco, Tabucchi, and many others). He lives and works in Milan.<p>&#x201c;Roberto Calasso's book, written in magnificent and supple prose and illustrated with reproductions of often little-known works of art, responds admirably to its title: it's the most absorbing guided visit that one could imagine of the brothel-museum of Baudelaire's dreams . . . One exits amazed by the intelligence and erudition of the guide, the foremost expert on a romantic and decadent Paris in which the rococo and neo-classical epochs remained living and present under the surface. And silently running throughout this account are the contradictory facets of the most gifted man in Paris at that time, Baudelaire, lover and critic of art, poet, journalist, bohemian, and dandy.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Marc Fumaroli, Commentaire</i></p><p>&#x201c;Roberto Calasso [is] the most inquisitively suggestive literary critic in the world today . . . <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is no narrow study of the poet's work or, even worse, a birth-to-death biography. Rather, by associating the poet with the prominent writers and artists with whom he came into contact, Calasso has created what he calls &#x2018;analogical history . . . an ever-more-urgent desideratum in an intellectually debilitated epoch such as the present.' A questioning assault upon the received wisdom, it exposes the hollow triumph of Impressionism and its artists, Renoir, Manet, Monet and Degas, over an implacable academy . . . the deeper purpose of Calasso's project can be glimpsed: a subtle inquiry into how the 19th century, and the popular description of it as a century of startling liberatory artistic promise and vast industrial progress, could give birth to a next century defined by Auschwitz, the gulag and Hiroshima.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Thomas McGonigle, The Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Calasso captures [Baudelaire's] shifting, overlapping world, never seeming overwhelmed by his material. Certain anecdotes stand out. Calasso is not afraid to show these figures as occasionally absurd. Ingres, a &#x2018;compact and stocky' man &#x2018;devoid of a sense of the ridiculous,' runs through his studio to launch himself on to a mattress in order to create interesting folds in a drape. Degas, a keen user of early photography, tries to capture the moon, only to find it &#x2018;moved too much.' Calasso also collects stories of supporting characters--from Degas's housekeeper to Baudelaire's mistress--to evoke an entire world. Such details, combined with his ear for a lyrical phrase, make <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> a joy to read.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Emma Hogan, Financial Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Calasso['s] ... extravagant admiration and connective intuition make a book of equal brilliance out of a chain of fragmentary reflections--Walter Benjamin might have called them blinks--beginning and ending with Charles Baudelaire (1821-67), cast as the primary metaphysician of modernity: part-creator, part-revelator, part-enactor of our signature condition . . . Calasso emphasizes Baudelaire's clarity and originality (his &#x2018;firsttimeness'), his imperativeness and his fearlessness . . . [Calasso's] Baudelaire is a person, not to say a personage. Part of the fascination of his book is its biographical or prosopographical color. &#x2018;Baudelaire was a dandy, especially in ruin,' Calasso observes characteristically, evoking him at 32, walking too cautiously, for fear of widening the rips in his clothes. &#x2018;He is a first Buster Keaton in a frock coat, who moves off, slowly, through the streets of Paris.' . . . The highlight of this ambitious enterprise is the reading or rereading of certain painters and paintings, in Baudelairian perspective . . . arresting observations on painters and paintings alike, aided and abetted by some discriminatingly chosen illustrations, beautifully reproduced . . . Calasso is one of the few to do justice to Degas's rabid antisemitism. He is also a great noticer of things in the paintings . . . Roberto Calasso wends his way, inviolate. <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is bedazzling.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alex Danchev, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;From a masterful biographical portrait of Baudelaire, the narrative spins out . . . to consider subjects as myriad as the airlessness of Ingres's neoclassicism, Chateaubriand's complaints about &#x2018;the vulgarity . . . of passports' and the African exile of French poetry's enfant terrible, Arthur Rimbaud . . . his eye for illuminating anecdote is peerless. Thus he informs us of Alberthe de Rubempr� who &#x2018;was the mistress, in rapid succession, of Delacroix, Stendhal and M�rim�e,' before waspishly adding: &#x2018;Each of them spoke too well of her to his best friend--and was then promptly ousted by him.' . . . <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is a concrete triumph, for its recreation of Baudelaire's milieu is so intensely vivid as to miraculously transform the distantly anecdotal into the seemingly actual.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Lucian Robinson, The Guardian</i></p><p>&#x201c;What a rare and special book this is, from its opening paragraph . . . But then what a rare writer is the prolific, post-Calvino Italian master Roberto Calasso--72-year-old scholar, translator, author of film scripts, radio and television adaptations, operatic librettos and seemingly most other viable prose forms in the late 20th and early 21st centuries . . . [<i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> is] an ideal introduction in English to one of the most urbane and readable of living masters.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jeff Simon, Buffalo News</i></p><p>&#x201c;In a series of elegant, passionate, erudite books, Calasso has attempted to map out an esoteric terrain: the metaphysical in literature. This study of Baudelaire and his era therefore represents a new stage in his project, developing from one of the essays in his Oxford lecture series, published as <i>Literature and the Gods</i>: an attempt to show how the metaphysical is still present, if in an occluded and buried form, even at the point when modernist literature begins . . . [Calasso's] book is baroque in its construction: its argument does not proceed from point to point but through a sequence of slow drifts and sudden aphoristic shocks. It is a gorgeous, willful, and convincing re-staging of Baudelaire's style . . . Toward the end of his book Calasso offers a final definition of his style: &#x2018;an audacity that came naturally to Baudelaire no less than did a certain wavelike motion of verse. And it is precisely the alternation between those two tempos--the prestissimo of provocation and the sforzato of the Alexandrine--that separates him from all those who came before him and those who were to follow him.' Or, to put this another way, he was revolutionary, sure--and yet, as Calasso observes beautifully, &#x2018;all his poetry seems translated from Latin.' Baudelaire was a classicist in his investigation of corruption. He was a constant double agent.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Adam Thirlwell, The New Republic</i></p><p>&#x201c;Calasso's book can be seen as a series of spirited improvisations on the theme expressed in Walter Benjamin's essays on Baudelaire: that the poet, though he remained resolutely in the Romantic tradition, was the first to express the dark new reality of what Benjamin called &#x2018;the permanent catastrophe' of life after the Industrial Revolution. Calasso illuminates this image of Baudelaire: the first poet to describe the shocking beauty of a decomposing corpse; to define the mixture of disgust, boredom, alienation, and fear that hung like a permanent fever mist in the brain of the city-dweller; to glory in the allure of the unhealthy, perverse and deformed, of the artificial and mechanical, of dissonance and fragmentation--all the scenery of destruction and despair that would become the natural landscape of writers from Kafka to Sartre and onward . . . Smoothing the way is the curiously conversational tone in which even the most arcane information is conveyed, as well as the underlying sense that, as the author piles detail upon detail, he's having a huge amount of fun. Calasso may identify with his hero, but there is no Baudelairean melancholy in his work. There's no show-off either--only a sincere delight, an innocent reveling in his own encyclopedic mind at play. This mood is catching, and if one adopts the right dreamy pace, one can commune with Calasso through a kind of imaginative osmosis.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Andrea Lee, Page-Turner (Newyorker.com)</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Roberto Calasso is] an ambitious artist-critic, pushing the subject as far as he can, bent on penetrating the mind of both Baudelaire and his time. In the process, he delivers plenty of insight. . . Tough but rewarding, written with bold intelligence and panache.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Roberto Calasso is] a writer about the foundational myths and tales of human society who has no equal in the sparkle of his storytelling and the depth of his learning . . . His writing . . . these lost voices speak again, in magical, uncanny and something even sinister ways . . . <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i> . . . now published in a translation by Alastair McEwen that captures all the shot-silk hues of Calasso's elegant, gnomic and epigrammatic prose, returns to that 19th-century &#x2018;landscape of the new' through glittering tableaux of the Parisian poet's life and work, and the art of his peers, from Ingres to Degas.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Boyd Tonkin, The Independent (London)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Calasso has the 19th-century savant's light touch in his knowledge of hieroglyphs, Greek myths and Hindu texts, Turkish and Chinese culture and the &#x2018;dandified' behaviour of the American Plains Indian. With chapters headed &#x2018;The Natural Obscurity of Things' and &#x2018;The Fleeting Sense of Modernity,' this well-illustrated volume is not a book for the faint-hearted. It is as red-blooded as art criticism gets, and a suitable encomium for the greatest of art critics.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jad Adams, The Telegraph</i></p><p>&#x201c;Let us lavish praise where praise is due: Roberto Calasso is the pre-eminent public intellectual of Western Europe, and perhaps the Western world. His extensive writings aim at nothing less than the recovery and reappropriation of the foundations of civilization. And he pursues his aim by reshaping and redirecting our vision toward the often obscure, but profoundly rich, synthesis of art, philosophy, literature and cultural theory that lies at the root of our identities . . . [In <i>La Folie Baudelaire</i>] he turns his formidable intellect to the birth of an era closer to home: the modern . . . [Calasso is] brilliant . . . pervasive in his studies . . . inventive in his narrative structure . . . Always surprising, never predictable, Calasso picks a progenitor of modernity that none of us would suspect . . . Charles Baudelaire, the Parisian enfant terrible, emblem of decadence and damnation to the status quo. Such eccentricity on Calasso's part allows "La Folie Baudelaire" to shine forth as his most accessible, satisfying book . . . to read Calasso's beautiful synthesis of the age in which Baudelaire flourished is to understand the poet as a Virgil to our Dante--exploring the labyrinthine depths of modernity's cult of endless images . . . For we moderns, as Calasso elegantly and authoritatively demonstrates, and as Baudelaire foretold: <i>The future is now</i>.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Arlice Davenport, The Wichita Eagle</i></p><p>&#x201c;Don't expect anything so obvious as a thesis; what we get instead is a companionable guided tour of mid- and late 19th century Paris, loosely organized around Baudelaire, his associates and enthusiasms, and the idea . . . that what we like to think of as the modern sensibility (urban, alienated, etc.) first recognized itself in that time and place. Perhaps not surprisingly, more than a touch of the <i>flaneur</i> hovers over the proceedings. Rambling across decades and art forms, Calasso--a polymathic one-man genre whose previous books have soared in the loftiest realms where culture intersects with ritual and myth--finds room, this time around, for jokes about Belgium and digressions on mistresses and breasts.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jeff Tompkins, PopMatters</i></p><p>&#x201c;At his best, Calasso is a writer of sufficient force and grace not only to summon the gods, but to make them come. A brief biographical note to Calasso's latest book describes the publication as &#x2018;the sixth panel' of &#x2018;a work in progress.' Calasso has been laboring at this project for 25 years, and his work to date . . . constitutes a major critical accomplishment.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Algis Valiunas, The Weekly Standard</i></p></p><h2>Advanced Chi Nei Tsang: Enhancing Chi Energy in the Vital Organs</h2><p>Advanced Taoist techniques for detoxifying and rejuvenating the internal organs through the release of negative chi <br> <br>� Works with the navel center, where negative emotions, stress, and illness accumulate <br> <br>� Presents advanced techniques to release negative energy from the body and reestablish a healthy flow of vital energy to internal tissues and organs <br> <br>From the Taoist point of view, good health depends upon the free flow of chi--healthy life-force energy--throughout the body.

They were met at dockside by hundreds of well-wishers displaying colorful banners, playing music on homemade instruments, and carrying giant bouquets of flowers. She was puzzled by this unusual welcome until her embarrassed husband explained that he was something more than a recently graduated mining engineer - he was the Prince of Hsipaw, the ruler of an autonomous state in Burma's Shan mountains. And these people were his subjects!</p><p>She immersed herself in the Shan lifestyle, eagerly learning the language, the culture, and the history of the Shan hill people. The Princess of Hsipaw fell in love with this remote, exotic land and its warm and friendly people. She worked at her husband's side to bring change and modernization to their primitive country. Her efforts to improve the education and health care of the country, and her husband's commitment to improve the economic well-being of the people made them one of the most popular ruling couples in Southeast Asia. Then the violent military coup of 1962 shattered the idyllic existence of the previous ten years. Her life irrevocably changed. Inge Sargent tells a story of a life most of us can only dream about. She vividly describes the social, religious, and political events she experienced. She details the day-to-day living as a "reluctant ruler" and her role as her husband's equal - a role that perplexed the males in Hsipaw and created awe in the females. And then she describes the military events that threatened her life and that of her children. </p><p><i>Twilight over Burma</i> is a story of a great happiness destroyed by evil, of one woman's determination and bravery against a ruthless military regime, and of the truth behind the overthrow of one of Burma's most popular local leaders.</p></p><p>&#39;Twilight over Burma&#39; is the story of a great happiness destroyed by evil, the overthrow of one of Burma&#39;s most respected local leaders, and one woman&#39;s determination and bravery against a ruthless military regime.Sargent's sad, exotic story survives her deeply flawed telling of it, but she would have been better advised to stick with a straightforward memoir. While at school in Colorado in the early '50s, the Austrian-born author met and married fellow student Sao Kya Seng. Because he wanted a wife who would marry him "for the right reasons," Sao chose not to tell Inge he was prince of Hsipaw, one of 34 independent Shan states in northeastern Burma (although the convertible Nash Rambler and the ruby-and-diamond engagement ring might have tipped her off.) For eight years the couple presided over the modernization of their small state, sadly unaware of the weak poltical leadership plaguing Burma since the 1947 assassination of General Aung San (father of jailed Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi). Then in 1962, General Ne Win seized power and Sao disappeared. Shadowed by Ne Win's men, Sargent waited desperately for news of her husband, until two years later friends convinced her to escape to Austria. Sargent's descriptions of life in the small, tropical state and of her machinations to smuggle out her daughters (both Burmese citizens) are strong enough to withstand her unconvincing re-creation of decades-old dialogue (even extensive sections on the vanished Sao's unknowable last thoughts) and the near-fatal decision to write in third person. Much of the book smacks of writing school exercises and the gutsy author often seems self-indulgent in descriptions of herself: "this attractive and unusual girl had constantly been on his mind. Her warmth, her cheerfulness, and her poise made him long for her company." <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Preaching as Testimony</h2><p><p>By exploring the historical, theoretical, and practical elements of the tradition of testimony, Anna Carter Florence seeks in this much-anticipated book to establish the historical and contemporary validity of women's preaching and to introduce testimony to a new generation of preachers and teachers. She begins with the stories of three women whose preaching was often described as testimony: Anne Marbury Hutchinson, Sarah Osborn, and Jarena Lee. Then, she examines biblical and theological perspectives on testimony. Finally, she explores how testimony plays out in a preacher's life, offering constructive proposals for preaching as well as helpful guidelines, direction, and exercises.</p></p><p><b>Anna Carter Florence</b> is Peter Marshall Associate Professor of Preaching at Columbia Theological Seminary in Decatur, Georgia.

Robin May&#39;s splendid work looks at the British Army that fought in the American Revolution from 1775 to 1783. It details the soldiers who faced the difficulties of campaigning in North America along with the gross inefficiency and corruption at home which, along with their generals&#39; often blundering conduct, were as deadly enemies as the Americans.</p><p>Packed with specially commissioned artwork, maps and diagrams, the Men-at-Arms series is an unrivalled illustrated reference on the history, organisation, uniforms and equipment of the world&#39;s military forces, past and present.Robin May was born in 1929.

Here are five of his No plays, stunning in their contemporary nature and relevance&#x2014;and finally made available again for readers to enjoy.</p><p><b>Yukio Mishima</b>&nbsp;was born in Tokyo in 1925. He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University&#x2019;s School of Jurisprudence in 1947. His first published book,&nbsp;<i>The Forest in Full Bloom</i>, appeared in 1944. He established himself as a major author with&nbsp;<i>Confessions of a Mask&nbsp;</i>(1949). From then until his death he continued to publish novels, short stories, and plays each year. His crowning achievement,&nbsp;<i>The Sea of Fertility</i>&nbsp;tetralogy&#x2014;which contains the novels&nbsp;<i>Spring Snow</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>Runaway Horses</i>&nbsp;(1969),&nbsp;<i>The Temple of Dawn</i>&nbsp;(1970), and&nbsp;<i>The Decay of the Angel&nbsp;</i>(1971)&#x2014;is considered one of the definitive works of twentieth-century Japanese fiction. In 1970, at the age of forty-five and the day after completing the last novel in the&nbsp;<i>Fertility</i>&nbsp;series, Mishima committed&nbsp;seppuku&nbsp;(ritual suicide)&#x2014;a spectacular death that attracted worldwide attention.THE SET is in extremely vulgar and commonplace taste, rather in the manner of sets used in operettas.<br><br>A corner of a park.

Five couples on the five benches are raptur�ously embracing.<br><br>A repulsive-looking OLD WOMAN enters, picking up ciga�rette butts. She goes on collecting them in the area around the five couples, quite oblivious to their discomfort, finally making her way to the bench in the center, where she sits. A shabbily dressed young POET comes under the lamppost and, drunkenly propping his body against it, observes the OLD WOMAN.<br><br>The couple on the center bench presently stand up in anger, with expressions of annoyance on their faces, and leave arm-in-arm. The OLD WOMAN, taking sole possession of the bench, spreads out a sheet of newspaper and starts counting the butts she has gathered.<br><br>OLD WOMAN One and one make two, two and two make four.... (She holds a stub up against the light and, determining that it is a fairly long one, goes to the couple at the left to ask for a light. She smokes for a while. W hen the ciga�rette burns down to a stub she grinds it out, throws it on the paper with the others, and begins to count again.) One and one make two, two and two make four....<br><br>POET (Comes up behind the OLD WOMAN and watches what she is doing.)<br><br>OLD WOMAN (her eyes still looking down at the paper) Want a smoke? I'll give you one if you want it. (She chooses a rather long stub and hands it to him.)<br><br>POET Thanks. (Takes out a match, lights the cigarette, and smokes.)<br><br>OLD WOMAN Is there something else? Have you got something to say to me?<br><br>POET No, not especially.<br><br>OLD WOMAN I know what you are. You're a poet. That's your business, isn't it?<br><br>POET How well you know. Yes, I write poems once in a while. There's no doubt but I'm a poet. But that doesn't make it a business.<br><br>OLD WOMAN Oh? You mean it's not a business unless your poems sell? (She looks up at the young man's face for the first time.) You're still young, aren't yOU? But you haven't much longer to live. The mark of death is on your face. <br><br>POET (not surprised) What were you in former life-a physiog�nomist?<br><br>OLD WOMAN Maybe. I've seen so many human faces I've become sick of them.... Sit down. You seem a little shaky on your feet.<br><br>POET (Sits; coughs.) I'm drunk, that's why.<br><br>OLD WOMAN Stupid. You should keep both feet planted firmly on the ground, at least as long as you're alive.<br><br>(Silence.) <br><br>POET You know, there's something that bothers me so much I can't stand it any more. Why do you come here every night at the same time and drive away whoever's here by sitting yourself on a bench?<br><br>OLD WOMAN Is this the bench you're complaining about? I don't sup�pose you can be a tramp. What do you want? Do you collect money from people who sit here?<br><br>POET No, it's simply that the bench can't talk for itself, so I'm talking for it.<br><br>OLD WOMAN (turning her attention from him) I'm not chasing anybody away. When I sit down they run away, that's all. Anyway, this bench is made for four people to sit on. <br><br>POET But at night it's for the use of lovers! Every evening when I pass through this park and I see a couple on every bench, it makes me feel so wonderfully reassured. I go 'by on tip�toes. Even if I'm tired or, as it happens once in a while, even if I feel inspiration coming over me, and I want to sit down so I can collect my thoughts, I refrain, in deference to them.... And you, old lady, since when have you been coming here?<br><br>OLD WOMAN Oh, I see now. This is your little area-your special pre�serve-where you do your business. <br><br>POET My what? <br><br>OLD WOMAN This is where you forage for things to put in your poems.<br><br>POET Don't be absurd. The park, the lovers, the lamposts-do you think I'd use such vulgar material?<br><br>OLD WOMAN In time it won't be vulgar. There's nothing that wasn't once vulgar. In time it'll change again.<br><br>POET What extraordinary things you come out with. If that's the case, I ought to deliver an impassioned plea on behalf of the bench.<br><br>OLD WOMAN How tiresome you are. All you can say is that my sitting here is an eyesore, isn't that it? <br><br>POET No-it's a profanation!<br><br>OLD WOMAN Young people really enjoy arguments.<br><br>POET Listen to me. . . . I am just what I seem, a threepenny poet, without even a woman who'll look at me. But there's something I respect-the world as reflected in the eyes of young people who love each other, a hundred times more beautiful than what they actually see-that I respect. Look, they're not the least aware we're talking about them. They've climbed up high as the stars. You can see the glint of starlight under their eyes, next to the cheeks. . . . And this bench, this bench is a kind of ladder mount�ing to heaven, the highest lookout tower in the world, a glorious observation point. When a man sits here with his sweetheart he can see the lights of the cities halfway across the globe. But if (climbs on the bench) I stand here all by myself, I can't see a thing.... Oh, I do see some�thing-lots of benches, somebody waving a flashlight� must be a policeman. A bonfire. Beggars crouching around the fire. The headlights of a car. They've passed each other now and are heading toward the tennis courts. What was that? A car full of flowers. Performers return�ing from a concert? Or a funeral procession? (He gets down from the bench and sits.) That's all I can see.<br><br>OLD WOMAN What rubbish. Why in the world do you respect such things? It's that same silly nature of yours which makes you write sentimental poems that nobody will buy. <br><br>POET And that's exactly why I never invade this bench. As long as you and I are occupying it, the bench is just so many dreary slats of wood, but if they sit here it can become a memory. It can become softer than a sofa, and warm with the sparks thrown off by living people. . . . When you sit here it becomes cold as a grave, like a bench put together out of slabs of tombstones. I can't bear that.<br><br>OLD WOMAN You're young and inexperienced, you still haven't the eyes to see things. You say the benches where they sit, those snotty-faced shop clerks with their whores, are alive? Don't be silly. They're petting on their graves. Look, how deathly pale their faces look in the greenish street light that comes through the leaves. Their eyes are shut, the men and women both. Don't they look like corpses? They're dying as they make love. (Sniffs around her.) There's a smell of flowers, all right. The flowers in the park are very fragrant at night, just like those inside a coffin. Those lovers are all buried in the smell of the flow�ers, like so many dead men. You and I are the only live ones.<br><br>POET (Laughs.) What a joke! You think you're more alive than they are?<br><br>OLD WOMAN Of course I do. I'm ninety-nine years old, and look how healthy I am.<br><br>POET Ninety-nine? <br><br>OLD WOMAN (turning her face into the light) Take a good look.<br><br>POET Horrible wrinkles! (Just then the man of the couple on the bench to the far right yawns.)<br><br>WOMAN What's the matter? What makes you so rude?<br><br>MAN Come on, let's be going. We'll catch cold.<br><br>WOMAN You are disagreeable. You must be very bored.<br><br>MAN No, I just remembered something funny.<br><br>WOMAN What is it? <br><br>MAN I was wondering whether my hen would lay an egg tomorrow, and it suddenly began to worry me. <br><br>WOMAN What's the meaning of that?<br><br>MAN There isn't any meaning.<br><br>WOMAN You and I are finished. That's what it means.<br><br>MAN Oh-there goes the last streetcar. We'll have to hurry.<br><br>WOMAN <br><br>(She rises and stares at the man.) What awful taste you have in neckties! (The man does not answer. He hurries the woman along and they exit.)<br><br>OLD WOMAN At last-they've come back to life.<br><br>POET The skyrockets have gone out. How can you say they've come back to life?<br><br>OLD WOMAN <br><br>I know what the face looks like of someone who's come back to life-I've seen it often enough. It wears an expres�sion of horrible boredom, and that expression is what I like.... Long ago, when I was young, I never had the sensation of being alive unless my head was all awhirl. I only felt I was living when I forgot myself completely. Since then I have realized my mistake. When the world seems wonderful to live in, and the meanest little flower looks big as a dome, and flying doves sing as they go by with human voices ... when, I mean, everyone in the whole world says "Good morning" joyously to everyone else, and things you've been searching for ten years turn up in the back of a cupboard, and every girl looks like an empress ... when you feel as if roses are blooming on the dead rose trees, then-idiotic things like that hap�pened to me once every ten days when I was young, but now when I think of it, I realize I was dying as it hap�pened.... The worse the liquor, the quicker you get drunk. In the midst of my drunkenness, in the midst of those sentimental feelings and my tears, I was dying. . . . Since then, I've made it a rule not to drink. That's the se�cret of my long life. <br><br>POET <br><br>(teasing her) Oh! And tell me, old lady, what is your rea�son for living?<br><br>OLD WOMAN <br><br>My reason? Don't be ridiculous! Isn't the very fact of ex�isting a reason in itself? I'm not a horse that runs because it wants a carrot. Horses, anyway, run because that's the way they're made.<br><br>POET "Run, run, little horse, looking neither right nor left"?<br><br>OLD WOMAN "Never moving once your eyes from your shadow's track."<br><br>POET When the sun goes down the shadow grows long.<br><br>OLD WOMAN <br><br>The shadow gets crooked. It gets lost in the darkness of evening. (As they talk the lovers on the benches around them all exit.)<br><br>POET Old lady, let me ask you something. Who are you?<br><br>OLD WOMAN <br><br>Once I was a woman called Komachi.<br><br>POET <br><br>Who? <br><br>OLD WOMAN <br><br>All the men who said I was beautiful have died. Now I feel for sure that any man who says I am beautiful will die.<br><br>POET (Laughs.) Well, I'm safe. I didn't meet you until you were ninety-nine.<br><br>OLD WOMAN <br><br>That's right, you're lucky.... But I suppose a fool like you thinks every beautiful woman gets ugly as soon as she grows old. Hah! That's a great mistake. A beautiful woman is always a beautiful woman. If I look ugly now, all it means is that I am an ugly beauty. After having been told so many times by everybody how lovely I looked, I have found it too much of a nuisance during the past seventy or eighty years to start thinking of myself as being anything but beautiful. I still see myself as a raving beauty.<br><br>POET <br><br>(aside) What a heavy burden it must be to have once been lovely. (To the OLD WOMAN.) I can understand how you feel. A man who's once gone to war reminisces about the war all the rest of his life. Of course you were beauti�ful. ... <br><br>OLD WOMAN (stamping her foot) Was? I still am beautiful.<br><br>POET Yes, yes, I understand. Why don't you tell me something about the old days? Eighty years ago, or was it ninety? (He counts on his fingers.) Tell me what happened eighty years ago.<br><br>OLD WOMAN <br><br>Eighty years ago . . . I was nineteen. Captain Fukakusa -he was at Staff Headquarters-was courting me.<br><br>POET Shall I pretend that I'm Captain what's-his-name?<br><br>OLD WOMAN Don't flatter yourself. He was a hundred times the man you are.... Yes, I told him I would grant what he desired if he visited me a hundred times. It was on the hun�dredth night. There was a ball at the Rokumei Hall, and simply everybody was there. I had become a little fatigued with all the heat of the party, and I was resting myself a moment on a bench in the garden....<br><br>(A waltz melody, faint at first but gradually becoming louder, is heard.

All the most boring people of the day have come.<br><br>POET <br><br>Those splendid-looking ladies and gentlemen?<br><br>OLD WOMAN Of course.

You're Captain Fukakusa.<br><br>(Three young couples wearing costumes of the 1880'/ enter waltzing. They move to where the two others are dancing. The waltz ends.

(She fin�gers the OLD WOMAN'S filthy rags.) <br><br>OLD WOMAN I sent my measurements to Paris and they made it for me there.<br><br>WOMAN A AND B Did you really? <br><br>WOMAN C It's the only way. There's always something slightly crude about any dress made by a Japanese.<br><br>MAN A One has no choice. One simply must wear imported clothes.<br><br>MAN B Yes, that's true for men too. Did you notice the frock coat the Prime Minister is wearing tonight? It was made in London-the home of gentlemen's fashions. <br><br>(The women chatting and laughing surround the OLD WOMAN and the POET. The three men sit on the end bench and talk.)<br><br>MAN C Komachi is certainly lovely.<br><br>MAN A <br><br>By moonlight even an old witch would look beautiful.<br><br>MAN B Komachi is one woman you can't say that about. She looks beautiful even in broad daylight. And when you see her in the moonlight, she's an angel, an angel from heaven. <br><br>MAN A She's not one to give in easily to any man.

It includes practical case studies and tutorials that will inform, inspire, and help you to conduct product design research better.<br><br>Product designers need a comprehensive understanding of research methods as their day-to-day work routinely involves them observing people, asking questions, searching for information, making and testing ideas, and ultimately generating 'solutions' to 'problems'. Manifest in the design process is the act of research. Huge technological advances in information, computing, and manufacturing processes also offer enormous opportunities to product designers such as the development of "intelligent" products and services, but at the same time raise important research questions that need to be dealt with. Product designers are, in many ways, best placed to address these challenges because of the manner in which they apply their design thinking to problems.</p><p>Alex Milton is Professor of Design and Head of the Faculty of Design at the National College of Art and Design, Ireland.<br><br>Paul Rodgers is Professor of Design Thinking in the School of Design at Northumbria University, UK.</p><h2>Full of Grace: Women and the Abundant Life</h2><p>We must be women who are spiritual mothers, women who are full of grace, women of the abundant life. &#x2014;from Chapter Eight <br><br>What happens when women give their lives over to God? They become vessels of grace, bearers of healing, consolation, encouragement and strength to a troubled world. Far from being passive, the woman of grace will actively embrace God's will, actively seek out the suffering and lost, and actively bring God's healing love to others. If she accepts God's call to authentic womanhood, her role, in the words of a closing speech at Vatican Council II, becomes nothing less than to "aid humanity in not falling." <i>Full of Grace</i> will empower all women to fully embrace their God-given identity.

Drawing on his breakthrough research in comparative neuroscience, Terrence Deacon offers a wealth of insights into the significance of symbolic thinking: from the co-evolutionary exchange between language and brains over two million years of hominid evolution to the ethical repercussions that followed man's newfound access to other people's thoughts and emotions.<br><br> Informing these insights is a new understanding of how Darwinian processes underlie the brain's development and function as well as its evolution. In contrast to much contemporary neuroscience that treats the brain as no more or less than a computer, Deacon provides a new clarity of vision into the mechanism of mind. It injects a renewed sense of adventure into the experience of being human.</p><p>Terrence Deacon's <i>The Symbolic Species</i> begins with a question posed by a 7-year-old child: Why can't animals talk? Or, as Deacon puts it, if animals have simpler brains, why can't they develop a simpler form of language to go with them? Thus begins the basic line of inquiry for this breathtakingly ambitious work, which attempts to describe the origins of human language and consciousness. <p> What separates humans from animals, Deacon writes, is our capacity for symbolic representation. Animals can easily learn to link a sound with an object or an effect with a cause. But symbolic thinking assumes the ability to associate things that might only rarely have a physical correlation; think of the word "unicorn," for instance, or the idea of the future. Language is only the outward expression of this symbolic ability, which lays the foundation for everything from human laughter to our compulsive search for meaning. </p><p> The final section of <i>The Symbolic Species</i> posits that human brains and human language have coevolved over millions of years, leading Deacon to the remarkable conclusion that many modern human traits were actually caused by <i>ideas</i>. Deacon's background in biological anthropology and neuroscience makes him a reliable companion through this complicated multidisciplinary turf. Rigorously researched and argued in dense but lively prose, <i>The Symbolic Species</i> is that rare animal, a book of serious science that's accessible to layman and scientist alike.</p>Terrence W. Deacon is a professor of biological anthropology and neuroscience and the chair of anthropology at the University of California, Berkeley. The author of The Symbolic Species and Incomplete Nature, he lives near Berkeley, California.</p><h2>Modern Standard Arabic Grammar: A Concise Guide (Arabic Edition)</h2><p>In a compact, easy-to-use format, this new book offers a convenient guide to grammar for any student of Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), the version of Arabic most commonly used in journalism, formal writing, and litera-ture.

These muralists conceived of their art as a political weapon in popular struggles over revolution and resistance, state modernization and civic participation, artistic freedom and cultural imperialism. The contributors to this volume show how these artists&#x2019; murals transcended borders to engage major issues raised by the many different forms of modernity that emerged throughout the Americas during the twentieth century.</p><p><b>Alejandro Anreus</b> is Associate Professor of Art History and Latin American Studies at William Paterson University.

It exposes the strengths and weaknesses of different theoretical orientations used in anthropology to study gender, difference, power, and inequality including feminist anthropology; black feminist anthropology; lesbian/gay/bisexual/transgendered theory; practice, postcolonial, symbolic, and psychological anthropology; as well as social evolutionism, sociobiology, and evolutionary psychology, among others. Mascia-Lees combines core components of these perspectives with insightful analyses and ethnographic examples to illustrate how global events and transformations have molded and continue to shape gender identities, behaviors, and expectations and produce and sustain worldwide inequalities. This exemplary treatment provides a solid background to understand complex issues and to think critically about remedying uneven degrees of privilege and experiences of oppression both within and across nations.

Low-performing schools, and the people who work in them, don't know what to do.

Theyhold such promise to make your life as a software designer and developereasier. Their terminology is bandied about every day in the technical and eventhe popular press. But it can be hard to learn them, to become proficient withthem, to understand what is really going on. <p></p>Perhaps you have been using an object-oriented or object-basedlanguage for years. Have you learned that the true power of objects is notinheritance but is in &#x201c;encapsulating behaviors&#x201d;? Perhaps you arecurious about design patterns and have found the literature a bit too esotericand high-falutin. If so, this book is for you. <p></p>It is based on years of teaching this material to softwaredevelopers, both experienced and new to object orientation. It is based uponthe belief&#x2014;and our experience&#x2014;that once you understand the basicprinciples and motivations that underlie these concepts, why they are doingwhat they do, your learning curve will be incredibly shorter. And in ourdiscussion of design patterns, you will understand the true mindset of objectorientation, which is a necessity before you can become proficient. <p></p>As you read this book, you will gain a solid understanding oftwelve core design patterns and a pattern used in analysis. You will learn thatdesign patterns do not exist in isolation, but work in concert with otherdesign patterns to help you create more robust applications. You will gain enoughof a foundation that you will be able to read the design pattern literature, ifyou want to, and possibly discover patterns on your own. Most importantly, youwill be better equipped to create flexible and complete software that is easierto maintain.<p></p>Although the twelve patterns we teach here are not all of thepatterns you should learn, an understanding of these will enable you to learnthe others on your own more easily. Instead of giving you more patterns thanyou need to get started, we have included pattern-related issues that will bemore useful.<p></p>From Object Orientation to Patterns to True Object Orientation<p></p>In many ways, this book is a retelling of my personalexperience learning design patterns. This started with learning the patternsthemselves and then learning the principles behind them. I expanded thisunderstanding into the realms of analysis and testing as well as learning howpatterns relate to agile coding methods. The second edition includes manyadditional insights I have had since publication of the first edition. Prior tostudying design patterns, I considered myself to be reasonably expert inobject-oriented analysis and design. My track record had included severalfairly impressive designs and implementations in many industries. I knew C++and was beginning to learn Java. The objects in my code were well-formed andtightly encapsulated. I could design excellent data abstractions forinheritance hierarchies. I thought I knew object-orientation. <p></p>Now, looking back, I see that I really did not understand thefull capabilities of object-oriented design, even though I was doing things theway most experts advised. It wasn&#x2019;t until I began to learn designpatterns that my object-oriented design abilities expanded and deepened.Knowing design patterns has made me a better designer, even when I don&#x2019;tuse these patterns directly.<p></p>I began studying design patterns in 1996. I was a C++/object�-orienteddesign mentor at a large aerospace company in the Northwest. Several peopleasked me to lead a design pattern study group. That&#x2019;s where I met myco-author, Jim Trott. In the study group, several interesting things happened.First, I grew fascinated with design patterns. I loved being able to compare mydesigns with the designs of others who had more experience than I. I discoveredthat I was not taking full advantage of designing to interfaces and that I didn&#x2019;talways concern myself with seeing if I could have an object use another objectwithout knowing the used object&#x2019;s type. I also noticed that beginners inobject-oriented design&#x2014;those who would normally be deemed as learningdesign patterns too early&#x2014;were benefiting as much from the study group asthe experts were. The patterns presented examples of excellent object-orienteddesigns and illustrated basic object-oriented principles, which helped tomature their designs more quickly. By the end of the study sessions, I wasconvinced that design patterns were the greatest thing to happen to softwaredesign since the invention of object-oriented design. <p></p>However, when I looked at my work at the time, I saw that I wasnot incorporating <i>any</i><i> </i>designpatterns into my code. Or, at least, not consciously. Later, after learningpatterns, I realized I had incorporated many design patterns into my code justout of being a good coder. However, now that I understand patterns better, I amable to use them better.<p></p>I just figured I didn&#x2019;t know enough design patterns yet andneeded to learn more. At the time, I only knew about six of them. Then I had anepiphany. I was working as a mentor in object-oriented design for a project andwas asked to create the project's high-level design. The leader of the projectwas extremely sharp, but was fairly new to object-oriented design.<p></p>The problem itself wasn&#x2019;t that difficult, but it required agreat deal of attention to make sure the code was going to be easy to maintain.Literally, after about two minutes of looking at the problem, I had developed adesign based on my normal approach of data abstraction. Unfortunately, it wasalso clear to me this was not going to be a good design. Data abstraction alonehad failed me. I had to find something better. <p></p>Two hours later, after applying every design technique I knew, Iwas no better off. My design was essentially the same. What was mostfrustrating was that I knew there was a better design. I just couldn&#x2019;tsee it. Ironically, I also knew of four design patterns that &#x201c;lived&#x201d;in my problem but I couldn&#x2019;t see how to use them. Here I was&#x2014;asupposed expert in object-oriented design&#x2014;baffled by a simple problem!<p></p>Feeling very frustrated, I took a break and started walking downthe hall to clear my head, telling myself I would not think of the problem forat least 10 minutes. Well, 30 seconds later, I was thinking about it again! ButI had gotten an insight that changed my view of design patterns: rather thanusing patterns as individual items, I should use the design patterns together. <p></p><i>Patterns are supposed to be sewn together to solve a problem.</i><p></p>I had heard this before, but hadn&#x2019;t really understood it.Because patterns in software have been introduced as <i>design</i> patterns, I had always labored under the assumptionthat they had mostly to do with design. My thoughts were that in the designworld, the patterns came as pretty much well-formed relationships betweenclasses. Then, I read Christopher Alexander&#x2019;s amazing book, TheTimeless Way of Building. I learned that patterns existed at all levels&#x2014;analysis,design, and implementation. Alexander discusses using patterns to help in theunderstanding of the problem domain (even in describing it), not just usingthem to create the design after the problem domain is understood.<p></p>My mistake had been in trying to create the classes in my problemdomain and then stitch them together to make a final system, a process whichAlexander calls a particularly bad idea. I had never asked if I had the rightclasses because they just seemed so right, so obvious; they were the classesthat immediately came to mind as I started my analysis, the &#x201c;nouns&#x201d;in the description of the system that we had been taught to look for. But I hadstruggled trying to piece them together. <p></p>When I stepped back and used design patterns and Alexander&#x2019;sapproach to guide me in the creation of my classes, a far superior solutionunfolded in only a matter of minutes. It was a good design and we put it intoproduction. I was excited&#x2014;excited to have designed a good solution andexcited about the power of design patterns. It was then that I startedincorporating design patterns into my development work and my teaching. <p></p>I began to discover that programmers who were new toobject-oriented design could learn design patterns, and in doing so, develop abasic set of object-oriented design skills. It was true for me and it was truefor the students that I was teaching. <p></p>Imagine my surprise! The design pattern books I had been readingand the design pattern experts I had been talking to were saying that youreally needed to have a good grounding in object-oriented design beforeembarking on a study of design patterns. Nevertheless, I saw, with my own eyes,students who learned object-oriented design concurrently with design patternslearned object-oriented design faster than those just studying object-orienteddesign. They even seemed to learn design patterns at almost the same rate asexperienced object-oriented practitioners.<p></p>I began to use design patterns as a basis for my teaching. Ibegan to call my classes <i>Pattern Oriented Design: Design Patterns fromAnalysis to Implementation</i>.<p></p>I wanted my students to understand these patterns and began todiscover that using an exploratory approach was the best way to foster thisunderstanding. For instance, I found that it was better to present the Bridgepattern by presenting a problem and then have my students try to design asolution to the problem using a few guiding principles and strategies that Ihad found were present in most of the patterns. In their exploration, thestudents discovered the solution&#x2014;essentially the Bridge pattern&#x2014;andremembered it. <p></p>&nbsp;<p></p> <b>Design Patterns and Agile/XP</b><p></p> The guiding principles and strategies underlying design patterns seem very clear to me now. Certainly, they are stated in the &#x201c;Gang of Four&#x2019;s&#x201d; design patterns book, but too succinctly to be of value to me when I first read it. I believe the Gang of Four were writing for the Smalltalk community which was very grounded in these principles and therefore needed little background. It took me a long time to understand them because of limitations in my own understanding of the object-oriented paradigm. It was only after integrating in my own mind the work of the Gang of Four with Alexander&#x2019;s work, Jim Coplien&#x2019;s work on commonality and variability analysis, and Martin Fowler&#x2019;s work in methodologies and analysis patterns that these principles became clear enough to me so that I was able to talk about them to others. It helped that I was making my livelihood explaining things to others so I couldn&#x2019;t get away with making assumptions as easily as I could when I was just doing things for myself.<p></p> Since the first edition of this book appeared, I have been doing a considerable amount of Agile development and have become very grounded in eXtreme Programming (XP) coding practices, Test-Driven-Development (TDD), and Scrum. Initially, I had a difficult time reconciling design patterns with XP and TDD. However, I quickly realized that both have great value and both are grounded in the same principles (although they take different design approaches). In fact, in our Agile software development boot camps, we make it clear that design patterns, used properly, are strong enablers of agile development.<p></p> I will discuss many of the ways design patterns relate to agile management and coding practices throughout the book. If you are not familiar with XP, TDD, or Scrum, do not be too concerned about these comments. However, if this is the case, I suggest the next book you read be about one of these topics.<p></p> &nbsp;<p></p>In any event, I found that these guiding principles andstrategies could be used to &#x201c;derive&#x201d; several of the design patterns.By &#x201c;derive a design pattern,&#x201d; I mean that if I looked at a problemthat might be solved by a design pattern, I could use the guiding principlesand strategies that I learned from patterns to come up with the solution thatis expressed in a pattern. I made it clear to my students that we weren&#x2019;treally coming up with design patterns this way. Instead, I was justillustrating one possible thought process that the people who came up with theoriginal solutions, those that were eventually classified as design patterns,might have used.<p></p>My abilities to explain these few, but powerful, principles andstrategies improved. As they did, I found that it became more useful to explainan increasing number of the Gang of Four patterns. In fact, I use theseprinciples and strategies to explain virtually all of the patterns I discuss inmy design patterns course.<p></p>I found that I was using these principles in my own designs bothwith and without patterns. This didn&#x2019;t surprise me. If using thesestrategies resulted in a design equivalent to a design pattern when I knew thepattern was present, that meant they were giving me a way to derive excellentdesigns (since patterns are excellent designs by definition). Why would I getany poorer designs from these techniques just because I didn&#x2019;t know thename of the pattern that might or might not be present anyway?<p></p>These insights helped hone my training process (and now mywriting process). I had already been teaching my courses on several levels. Iwas teaching the fundamentals of object-oriented analysis and design. I didthat by teaching design patterns and using them to illus...<p> <b>Alan Shalloway</b> is founder, CEO, and principal consultant of Net Objectives, an object-oriented consulting and training organization.

Far broader than just the critical struggle between Allies and Axis, its ramifications were felt throughout the world. It was a time of social relocation, reorienting ideas of patriotism and geographical attachment, and forcing the movement of people across oceans and continents. In <em>India at War</em>, Yasmin Khan offers an account of India's role in the conflict, one that takes into consideration the social, economic, and cultural changes that occurred in South Asia between 1939 and 1945-and reveals how vital the Commonwealth's contribution was to the war effort. <br><br>Khan's sweeping work centers on the lives of ordinary Indian people, exploring the ways they were affected by a cataclysmic war with origins far beyond Indian shores. In manpower alone, India's contribution was staggering; it produced the largest volunteer army in world history, with 2.5 million men. Indians were engaged in making the raw materials and food stuffs needed by the Allies, and became involved in the construction of airstrips, barracks, hospitals, internee camps, roads and railways. Their lives were also profoundly affected by the presence of the large Allied army in the region, including not only British but American, African, and Chinese troops. Madras was bombed by the Japanese and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands were occupied, while the Bengal famine of 1943-in which perhaps three million Bengalis died-was a man-made disaster precipitated by the effects of the war. <br><br>This authoritative account offers a critically important look at the contributions of colonial manpower and resources essential to sustaining the war, and emphasizes the significant ways in which the conflict shaped modern India.<br></p><p><br><strong>Yasmin Khan</strong> is an Associate Professor of History at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of Kellogg College. Her first book, <em>The Great Partition: The Making of India and Pakistan</em>, won the Gladstone Prize for History from the Royal Historical Society.<br><br>"This new book is an elegant and gripping evocation of the war's transformative effects on Indian society, braiding together the stories of soldiers, activists, and citizens as they navigated a conflicting morass of political and social expectations.

Know what you can afford--and stick to your budget.</strong> This is true of any market, of course. But when there are lots of houses on the market, it can be easy to slip into the mindset that any home is yours for the taking: &#x201c;Another bedroom might be nice, or a family room and a great room....&#x201d;</p> <p> Don&#x2019;t treat your local housing market like an all-you-can-eat buffet. Before you shop for a home, know your needs and your budget, and focus on homes that fit those. To track your spending, try the free budget planner spreadsheet from Spreadsheets123. </p> <p> <strong>2. Get preapproved.</strong> This is a good idea whenever you shop for a home, buyer&#x2019;s market or not. Preapproval means that a lender has given you the green light to borrow a certain amount of money before you start shopping. It helps you know how much home you can afford, and it also streamlines the mortgage application process. And it signals to sellers that you can follow through on your offer&#x2014;a big bonus at a time when mortgages are tough to get.</p> <p> <strong>3. Work with a buyer&#x2019;s agent.</strong> A buyer&#x2019;s agent represents you and your interests exclusively in a real estate transaction. If you don&#x2019;t have an explicit buyer&#x2019;s agency agreement, your agent may actually be working for the seller. If you&#x2019;re not sure that your agent is a buyer&#x2019;s agent, ask. You need to be sure that your agent works for you, 100 percent.</p> <p> <strong>4. Negotiate your agent&#x2019;s commission.</strong> Real estate agents earn their money by commission, and that means they get paid only when they sell a home. In a buyer&#x2019;s market, when sales are sluggish, your agent may be willing to return a portion of her commission to you as a rebate at closing. Why? Agents waste a lot of time working with window-shoppers who never make an offer. A rebate may induce you to follow through and buy a home.</p> <p> <strong>5. Do your research.</strong> Before you make an offer, spend some time looking at similar properties that have sold in your area recently (the last six months), called comparables or comps. (Your real estate agent can get you the most recent data.) If selling prices are consistently lower than list prices, you&#x2019;ve got a good chance of having a lower-than-list-price offer accepted.</p> <p> <strong>6. Use online resources.</strong> Thanks to the Internet, it&#x2019;s easier than ever before to get information about your local housing market&#x2014;and you can do so in your pajamas and bunny slippers. Use sites like Trulia.com to find homes, check a particular home&#x2019;s price history, and compare it to recent sales in the area. Zillow gives you a computer-generated estimate, called a &#x201c;Zestimate,&#x201d; of a home&#x2019;s value.</p> <p> <strong>7. Don&#x2019;t assume all sellers are desperate.</strong> Some buyers lose out on homes they want to buy because they think that a buyer&#x2019;s market means the buyer calls all the shots. They make an insultingly low-ball offer and are surprised when the seller turns them down. As a buyer, you&#x2019;re in a good negotiating position, sure. But a seller isn&#x2019;t obliged to sell his home at any price. There are other pressures on the seller, like having to pay off his current mortgage. When you make an offer, be reasonable.</p> <p> <strong>8. Consider short sales and REOs.</strong> In a short sale, the current mortgage-holder agrees to a sale price that&#x2019;s less than the seller owes on the home. An REO is a property that&#x2019;s gone through foreclosure and is now owned by the lender.</p> <p> You can find bargains among short sales and REOs, but you need to look at these properties in context. Are prices still falling, meaning the home will continue to lose value? Is the house in acceptable condition? Many short sales and REOs are sold &#x201c;as is,&#x201d; which means the seller won&#x2019;t help pay for repairs. If you&#x2019;re looking at short sales and REOs, be sure to work with a buyer&#x2019;s agent who&#x2019;s familiar with the ins and outs of the distressed housing market.</p> <p> <strong>9. Negotiate for the best price.</strong> In a buyer&#x2019;s market, some sellers try to get buyers&#x2019; attention by throwing a new flat-screen TV or a cruise into the deal as an enticement. Instead of going for a $1,000 gimmick, ask the seller for $1,000 off the price. You&#x2019;ll save money in the long run by reducing the size of your mortgage and the interest you pay on it.</p> <p> <strong>10. If you want something, ask for it.</strong> If you think the seller&#x2019;s furniture looks better in the living room than yours would, ask the seller to include it in the sale. If you&#x2019;re buying in a new development, ask the developer for free custom touches or appliance upgrades. The seller can always say no, but she might agree for the sake of the deal. In a buyer&#x2019;s market, it never hurts to ask.</p></p><p><b>Nancy Conner</b> has a PhD from Brown University and has taught writing, including technical writing, to college students and professionals for more than a dozen years.

She has taught at a number of North American colleges and universities, and is the author of The Initiation of the Second Macedonian War and Roman Religion: A Sourcebook.</p><h2>Essays on the Theory of Numbers (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p><p>This volume contains the two most important essays on the logical foundations of the number system by the famous German mathematician J. W. R. Dedekind. The first presents Dedekind's theory of the irrational number-the Dedekind cut idea-perhaps the most famous of several such theories created in the 19th century to give a precise meaning to irrational numbers, which had been used on an intuitive basis since Greek times. This paper provided a purely arithmetic and perfectly rigorous foundation for the irrational numbers and thereby a rigorous meaning of continuity in analysis.<br>The second essay is an attempt to give a logical basis for transfinite numbers and properties of the natural numbers. It examines the notion of natural numbers, the distinction between finite and transfinite (infinite) whole numbers, and the logical validity of the type of proof called mathematical or complete induction.<br>The contents of these essays belong to the foundations of mathematics and will be welcomed by those who are prepared to look into the somewhat subtle meanings of the elements of our number system. As a major work of an important mathematician, the book deserves a place in the personal library of every practicing mathematician and every teacher and historian of mathematics.

It features skill building with a solid theoretical base, and provides students with an overview of early childhood programs through the use of examples, anecdotes, and scenarios. Readers will come away with an understanding of what makes a quality program, where children gain the foundations they need for school success and beyond</p><p>Janet Gonzalez-Mena started her early childhood career in a cooperative preschool as a parent volunteer back in 1966. She then became a Head Start volunteer and ended up as a teacher in a preschool for Spanish-speaking children and their families in 1970&#x2019;s. She has also helped open several pilot programs including a therapeutic child care program and a home-based bilingual preschool program. When Magda Gerber came into her life in the mid-1970&#x2019;s, Janet signed up for an internship with her at the Children&#x2019;s Health Council in Menlo Park, California. As a result of that experience, later, when she became a child care director, she was able to incorporate much of what she learned into her work and was influential in expanding that program to include an infant center. Training and teaching adults has always been sideline, even when she was working with children and families. She worked as a Head Start trainer and as adjunct faculty in 4 community colleges plus the University of California Santa Cruz credential extension program. She taught for 15 years as full time faculty at Napa Valley College in the Child and Family Studies Program. Since 1991, she has been part of the faculty for WestEd&#x2019;s Program for Infant-Toddler Caregivers (PITC) Training of Trainer Institutes. Janet has been writing along with teaching for all these years and is author of numerous articles and 13 books related to early childhood, including Foundations of Early Childhood Education; Infants, Toddlers, and Caregivers (with co-author Dianne Eyer); and Diversity in Early Care and Education: Honoring Differences (Formerly Multicultural Issues in Child Care). She wrote Dragon Mom about herself as parent to help early childhood professionals alleviate guilt when their parenting doesn't live up to their high standards. Her latest passion is understanding more about the Pikler Institute in Budapest, Hungary, where Magda Gerber came from. It took her 30 years to get there after she first heard of it, but her first trip to it in November of 2003 merely whetted her appetite. She has made two more since and is planning for another one. She is fascinated by the approach and is convinced that this residential nursery is a model for the world. She is continuing to learn more about how this approach can be used to improve infant-toddler care and education programs in the United States. She is also working with a group in Mexico to explore how the approach might fit into their models of residential care for infants and toddlers. Janet has a Master of Arts Degree in Human Development from Pacific Oaks in Pasadena, California.</p><h2>X-Ray Diffraction (Dover Books on Physics)</h2><p><p>Basic diffraction theory has numerous important applications in solid-state physics and physical metallurgy, and this graduate-level text is the ideal introduction to the fundamentals of the discipline.

During the decades that followed, the Ottomans became progressively more engaged in the affairs of this vast and previously unfamiliar region, eventually to the point of launching a systematic ideological, military and commercial challenge to the Portuguese Empire, their main rival for control of the lucrative trade routes of maritime Asia.<br><br><em>The Ottoman Age of Exploration</em> is the first comprehensive historical account of this century-long struggle for global dominance, a struggle that raged from the shores of the Mediterranean to the Straits of Malacca, and from the interior of Africa to the steppes of Central Asia. Based on extensive research in the archives of Turkey and Portugal, as well as materials written on three continents and in a half dozen languages, it presents an unprecedented picture of the global reach of the Ottoman state during the sixteenth century. It does so through a dramatic recounting of the lives of sultans and viziers, spies, corsairs, soldiers-of-fortune, and women from the imperial harem. Challenging traditional narratives of Western dominance, it argues that the Ottomans were not only active participants in the Age of Exploration, but ultimately bested the Portuguese in the game of global politics by using sea power, dynastic prestige, and commercial savoir faire to create their own imperial dominion throughout the Indian Ocean.<br></p><p><br><strong>Giancarlo Casale </strong>is Assistant Professor of the History of the Islamic World and the 2009-2011 McKnight Land Grant Professor at the University of Minnesota.<br><br>"[A]n important work."--<em>The Historian</em><p></p><br>"Far from being bystanders, the Ottomans emerge from Giancarlo Casale's study as key actors in the sixteenth-century age of exploration. Their 1517 conquest of Egypt made the Empire into a major Red Sea power. It also made the Ottoman sultans the Protectors of the Two Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina and gave them claims to being the most prestigious Muslim sovereigns. Exploding conventional opinions about the Ottomans as a land-based power, about their lack of prowess in seafaring, about their inward-looking commercial policy, and about their cultural introversion, Casale has produced a study of enduring significance for the history of the Ottoman Empire and of the whole sixteenth-century world."--Carter V. Findley, author of <em>The Turks in World History</em><p></p><br>"Casale has made a major contribution to the intellectual and cultural history of the Ottoman Empire. He shows that the Ottoman conquest of the Arab world was no mere acquisition of territory. Through the Arab lands, the Ottomans discovered the Indian Ocean and embarked on an intellectual journey through the previously unknown world of medieval Arab scholarship."--Molly Greene, Princeton University <br><p></p><br>"This path-breaking account of Ottoman exploration of the Indian Ocean upends a number of assumptions about imperial aspirations, mercantile aptitudes, and modes of expansion and alliance-building. Giancarlo Casale gives us a wonderfully lively narrative of a century of Ottoman rivalry with the Portuguese, against whom the empire deployed technological know-how, persuasive rhetoric, effective political and geographic intelligence, and above all a series of gifted and daring statesmen and seamen."--Leslie Peirce, New York University <br><p></p><br>"Giancarlo Casale challenges the master narrative that portrays Christian Europeans as the sole maritime explorers of the sixteenth century. Making room for the Ottoman Turks will discomfit world historians, but the power and elegance of Casale's argument and the weight of the evidence he presents cannot be denied."--Richard W. Bulliet, Columbia University<p></p><br>"Once in a while, one has the opportunity to read a monograph that changes the way you envision a people, empire or event and, thus, changes the way you teach the particular subject in the classroom. Giancarlo Casale's book on the Ottomans in the sixteenth century accomplishes just that. His arguments are sure to spawn interesting debate and will also find their way into classrooms, providing scholars and students confirmation that the Ottomans were agents of change in the Indian Ocean and its spice trade."--Kathy Callahan, <em>World History Bulletin</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Alternative Approaches to Assessing Young Children</h2><p>In today's climate of increased accountability and diversity, alternative assessments for young children are more important than ever.

The main topic is how the Ixtepejanos perceive reality as potentially dangerous: perilous beings abiding in the air and friends and family possessed by envy pose constant threats to self-esteem and interpersonal relationships. Such perceptions affect, and in turn are affected by, the conduct of village life&#x2014;a life that centers on hard work and a struggle to survive in a harsh environment.</p><p> Ixtepejanos, who believe they are abandoned to their existence, are also aware of an idealized vision of another world, glimpsed in magazines, movies, and trips to the city. This other world&#x2014;forever unattainable&#x2014;is one of unlimited wealth and power, of security and happiness. In an attempt to adjust to their own deficient world, Ixtepejanos repress their desire for better conditions, drink to create a more ideal environment, and disparage themselves&#x2014;acts that only intensify a barely tolerable existence. Although world view is the prevailing focus of Kearney's cognitive study, other salient features of the cultural and social systems are effectively dealt with and interrelated, including politics, economics, and religion. </p><p> Title of related interest from Waveland Press: Chinas, <i>La Zandunga: Of Fieldwork and Friendship in Southern Mexico</i> (ISBN 9780881336801).</p></p><p>Title of related interest from Waveland Press: Chinas, La Zandunga: Of Fieldwork and Friendship in Southern Mexico (ISBN 9780881336801).</p><h2>Wounded City: Violent Turf Wars in a Chicago Barrio</h2><p>In 2009, Chicago spent millions of dollars to create programs to prevent gang violence in some of its most disadvantaged neighborhoods. Yet in spite of the programs, violence has grown worse in some of the very neighborhoods that the violence prevention programs were intented to help. While public officials and social scientists often attribute the violence - and the failure of the programs - to a lack of community in poor neighborhoods, closer study reveals another source of community division: local politics.<br><br>Through an ethnographic case study of Chicago's Little Village neighborhood, <em>Wounded City</em> dispells the popular belief that a lack of community is the primary source of violence, arguing that competition for political power and state resources often undermine efforts to reduce gang violence. Robert Vargas argues that the state, through the way it governs, can contribute to distrust and division among community members, thereby undermining social cohesion. The strategic actions taken by police officers, politicians, nonprofit organizations, and gangs to collaborate or compete for power and resources can vary block by block, triggering violence on some blocks while successfully preventing it on others. <br><br>A rich blend of urban politics, sociology, and criminology, <em>Wounded City</em> offers a cautionary tale for elected officials, state agencies, and community based organizations involved with poor neighborhoods.<br></p><p><br><b>Robert Vargas </b>is a Neubauer Family Assistant Professor at the University of ChicagoWinner of the 2016 Outstanding Book Prize from the Academy of Criminal Justice Sciences<br> Winner of the 2017 Betty and Alfred McClung Lee Book Award from the Association of Humanist SociologyCo-Winner of 2016 Best Book Award from the American Sociological Association Section on Political SociologyCo-Winner of 2016 Outstanding Book Prize from the American Sociological Association Section on Peace, War, and Social ConflictFinalist, 2016 C.

Like the blockbuster that came before it, Volume 2 of Uncovering Student Ideas in Science will reveal the surprising misconceptions students bring to the classroom so you can adjust your teaching to replace those ideas with a sound understanding of science. The field-tested features from Volume 1 are all here. The 25 new probes are short, easy-to-administer activities designed to determine what students at every grade level know (or think they know) about core science topics. The probes come all ready to reproduce. Accompanying teacher materials explain science content, note links to national standards, and suggest grade-appropriate ways to present material so students will learn it accurately. But where Volume 1 emphasized physical science, Volume 2 covers more life science and Earth and space science probes. New topic areas include forms of matter, changes in matter, living things and life processes, rocks and landforms, the day/night cycle, and objects in the night sky. Volume 2 also suggests ways to embed the probes throughout the course of your instruction, not just when starting a unit or topic.</p><p>Page Keeley is senior science program director, Francis Eberle is executive director, and Joyce Tugel is science specialist at the Maine Mathematics and Science Alliance, where they develop, coordinate, and implement science education initiatives at the state and national levels.

I used the series Uncovering Student Ideas in Science in two of my workshops on lecture-free teaching. These sessions were for high school and middle school science teachers. In one instance, the teachers (with whom I had worked previously) picked one of the formative assessments, tried it in their classrooms before the scheduled workshop date, and reported to the rest of the group about how it worked. In the second instance, I brought the books to the workshop and gave the teachers about 30 minutes to find an assessment appropriate for one of their classes, make copies for the other participants, and try the assessment on the workshop participants. In both cases each presentation was followed by critique and suggestions from other workshop participants. --Reviewed by: Bonnie Wood (Presque Isle, ME) on July 24, 2008</p><h2>Violin: A Novel</h2><p>In the grand manner of Interview with the Vampire, Anne Rice&#39;s new novel moves across time and the continents, from nineteenth-century Vienna to a St. Charles Greek Revival mansion in present-day New Orleans to dazzling capitals of the modern-day world, telling a story of two charismatic figures bound to each other by a passionate commitment to music as a means of rapture, seduction, and liberation.</p><p>If neatness counts for you, don't count on Anne Rice's musical-ghost novel <i>Violin</i>. It is an eruption of the author's personal demons, as messy as the monster bursting from that poor fellow's chest in the movie <i>Alien</i>. Like Rice, the heroine Triana lives in New Orleans, mourns a dead young daughter and a drunken mother, and is subject to uncanny visions. A violin-virtuoso ghost named Stefan time-trips and globetrots with Triana, taunting her for her inability to play his Stradivarius--which echoes composer Salieri's jealousy in <i>Amadeus</i> and possibly Rice's jealousy of her successful poet husband Stan Rice in the years before her own florid, lurid writing made her famous. The storytelling here is too abstract, but the almost certainly autobiographical emotions could not be more visceral. At one point, the narrator exclaims, "Shame, blame, maim, pain, vain!" But Rice's dip in the acid bath of memory was not in vain--she packs the pain of a lifetime into 289 pages.ANNE RICE is the author of twenty-one books.

Bailey. With widespread publicity concerning the near death experience, many people are now searching for a deeper understanding of death and the process of dying. Esoteric teachings on the subtle bodies and their interrelationship have much to offer to those pondering on and researching the mystery of death. The extracts contained in this book, taken as seed thoughts or ideas for reflection, will help readers to clarify their own ideas and attitudes on this important subject. One quote from this book states: This, our present cycle, is the end of the age, and the next two hundred years will see the abolition of death, as we now understand that great transition, and the establishing of the fact of the soul&#39;s existence.</p><p>Alice A. Bailey (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction - towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master, and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality - her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching. A total of twenty-four books were written by Alice Bailey. These books constitute a continuation of the Ageless Wisdom, a body of esoteric teaching handed down from ancient times in a form which is always suitable to each period. Intended to precede and condition the New Age, the Alice Bailey books offer an unparalleled spiritual approach to the teaching on Shamballa and the Path of spiritual evolution; the spiritual Hierarchy; the new discipleship and training in meditation as a form of service; the teaching on the seven rays and the new psychology of the soul; and the common thread of truth linking all the major world faiths. In addition to her work as an author and lecturer, Alice Bailey established the Lucis Publishing Company, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world for over 75 years. Reprinting of the books is financed through a revolving Fund under the administration of the Lucis Trust, a non-profit organization also founded by Alice A. Bailey. No royalties are paid and copyrights are owned by the Lucis Trust. Through these organizations, Alice Bailey provided for the continued publication of these teachings beyond her physical lifetime.</p><h2>The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age</h2><p>Myth of the Strong Leader</p><p>Archie Brown is a British political scientist and historian.

A Fellow of the British Academy since 1991, Professor Brown was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2003. He has written widely on Soviet and Communist politics, the Cold War, and political leadership.&#34;An important and unusual read... Brown does a wonderful job of showing how the same qualities that can seem so appealing in strong leaders can lead, in the mildest cases, to bad decisions - and, in the most extreme cases, to death and suffering on a massive scale... Though The Myth of the Strong Leader is about political leadership, you come away from Brown&#39;s book with a deeper understanding of leadership in general&#34; -- Bill Gates &#34;A profound, and wise, book - one of the most important works on politics for a long time. On the basis of penetrating, wide-ranging analysis, traversing democratic and authoritarian systems, Archie Brown clearly demonstrates the commonly held belief in strong leadership as the answer to political problems to be completely, often disastrously, misplaced.&#34; -- Sir Ian Kershaw &#34;A brilliant exploration of political leaders in democratic, authoritarian and totalitarian regimes... Brown&#39;s excellent book stresses the importance of the context for the appearance of effective leaders and, when dealing with democratic regimes, the importance of the institutions&#34; Political Quarterly &#34;The best analysis of the nature of true leadership I have read.&#34; -- Gary Hart, Former United States Senator &#34;This book badly needed to be written, and only Archie Brown - with his unique breadth of scholarly knowledge combined with a finger-tip feel for real-world politics - could possibly have written it. It turns out that there are fewer strong leaders in the world than is often supposed and that many of them, far from being desirable, are positively dangerous. Perhaps the best political systems are those that are effectively &#34;leader-proofed&#34;.&#34; -- Anthony King, Professor of Government at the University of Essex and co-author of The Blunders of Our Governments</p><h2>The Greek Connection: The Life of Elias Demetracopoulos and the Untold Story of Watergate</h2><p><b>The incredible true story of the dissident journalist who went from being a 13 year-old resistance fighter in Nazi-occupied Greece, to a Washington insider who -- according to Christopher Hitchens -- uncovered the secret behind Watergate.</b><br><br>Elias Demetracopolous (1928-2016) is perhaps one of the most overlooked figures in 20th century political history. <br><br>As a 13 year-old in occupied Greece he was tortured and imprisoned for his daring resistance efforts against the Nazis.

He became the object of CIA, FBI, and State Department surveillance and smear campaigns.

Both a scientist and a preacher, David Snoke presents a theological study of several themes in the evolution discussion, including the balance theme of Scripture and the day-age interpretation. Complete with an appendix that gives a literal translation of Genesis 1-11, this intriguing study will interest both scientists and lay Christians who want to dig into the faith-science intersection.</p><p>Young-earth creationism?

Although this story happened a long time ago, during another time of war between Islam and the West, this tale of an individual life fully lived is the tale of every life. In the tradition of Siddhartha or The Last Temptation of Christ, his story is the mythic story of the human soul. We watch his faith tested, and we witness his meeting with the beloved which overturned his world and led, eventually, to his union with God. For centuries Rumi has remained alive in the hearts of millions around the world. His story, as told in this novel, burns like a torch of inspiration for us all.</p><p><b>Connie Zweig, Ph.D.</b>, a student of Hinduism, Buddhism, and Sufism for more than 30 years, is a Jungian therapist and spiritual counselor in Los Angeles.

It played a key role in the settling of the New World and the outcome of the Revolutionary War, and was the birthplace of the environmental movement. Now Hudson Talbott pays homage to the river that shares his name in a gorgeously illustrated, fascinating account of the river?s history.<p> Each appealing spread sheds exciting light on the river?s strategic, economic and cultural signifi cance. Packed with facts, timelines and maps, this is a wonderful introduction to a wide range of topics including the Age of Exploration, the Erie Canal, the Industrial Age, American arts and literature and the environment. <i>River of Dreams</i> is truly a book with something for everyone.<br><br></p></p><p><b>Hudson Talbott</b> (www.hudsontalbott.com) wrote and illustrated <i>From Wolf to Woof</i>, <i>United Tweets of America</i>, <i>River of Dreams</i>, and<i> It&#x2019;s All About Me-ow</i>, and he has illustrated numerous picture books, including Newbery Honor winner <i>Show Way </i>(by Jacqueline Woodson) and <i>Leonardo&#x2019;s Horse </i>(by Jean Fritz), an ALA Notable Book and a VOYA Honor Book. He lives in the Hudson Valley of New York and New York City.Grade 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;A boy gazes from his nighttime window, dreaming of New York, "the great city on the river that bore my name&#x2014;Hudson." This personalized opening has the look of a bedtime story and may deter some readers, but Talbott uses dreams as a theme around which he winds an engaging history. He adroitly utilizes the picture-book format to chronicle the Hudson's course through the experiences of various dreamers. He describes the long period of habitation by Native peoples, settlement by Holland and then by England, the "American" revolt against English rule, the post-Revolution boom in shipping traffic, the building of the Erie Canal, and more. Watercolor, colored pencil, and ink illustrations are filled with scenes that are sometimes realistic, at other times more fanciful. A few spreads have color blocks, vignettes, information bits, and a winding river that bears significant dates. The river hit hard times as the rush to commerce made it a dumping ground; it is now in recovery. Echoing the opening tone, he closes with a romanticized and personal note: "It's now my turn to help in keeping the river of dreams flowing, for all those dreamers yet to come." The further reading list and Web sites are of adult interest, but the well-crafted story is an informative and interesting account for personal reading or classroom units in history or environmental issues.&#x2014;<i>Margaret Bush, Simmons College, Boston</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

These included rabid warriors like defrocked military general Edwin A. Walker; the world's richest oil baron, H. L. Hunt; the leader of the largest Baptist congregation in the world, W.A. Criswell; and the media mogul Ted Dealey, who raucously confronted JFK and whose family name adorns the plaza where the president was murdered. On the same stage was a compelling cast of marauding gangsters, swashbuckling politicos, unsung civil rights heroes, and a stylish millionaire anxious to save his doomed city.<br><br>Bill Minutaglio and Steven L. Davis ingeniously explore the swirling forces that led many people to warn President Kennedy to avoid Dallas on his fateful trip to Texas. Breathtakingly paced, DALLAS 1963 presents a clear, cinematic, and revelatory look at the shocking tragedy that transformed America. Countless authors have attempted to explain the assassination, but no one has ever bothered to explain Dallas-until now.<br><br>With spellbinding storytelling, Minutaglio and Davis lead us through intimate glimpses of the Kennedy family and the machinations of the Kennedy White House, to the obsessed men in Dallas who concocted the climate of hatred that led many to blame the city for the president's death. Here at long last is an accurate understanding of what happened in the weeks and months leading to John F. Kennedy's assassination. DALLAS 1963 is not only a fresh look at a momentous national tragedy but a sobering reminder of how radical, polarizing ideologies can poison a city-and a nation.</p><p><b>Bill Minutaglio</b> has been published in the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Newsweek</i>, <i>Texas Monthly</i>, and the <i>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>.

In The Lady and the Panda, Vicki Constantine Croke gives us the remarkable account of Ruth Harkness and her extraordinary journey, and restores Harkness to her rightful place along with Sacajawea, Nellie Bly, and Amelia Earhart as one of the great woman adventurers of all time.<br><br>Ruth was the toast of 1930s New York, a dress designer newly married to a wealthy adventurer, Bill Harkness. Just weeks after their wedding, however, Bill decamped for China in hopes of becoming the first Westerner to capture a giant panda&#x2013;an expedition on which many had embarked and failed miserably. Bill was also to fail in his quest, dying horribly alone in China and leaving his widow heartbroken and adrift. And so Ruth made the fateful decision to adopt her husband&#x2019;s dream as her own and set off on the adventure of a lifetime.<br><br>It was not easy. Indeed, everything was against Ruth Harkness. In decadent Shanghai, the exclusive fraternity of white male explorers patronized her, scorned her, and joked about her softness, her lack of experience and money. But Ruth ignored them, organizing, outfitting, and leading a bare-bones campaign into the majestic but treacherous hinterlands where China borders Tibet. As her partner she chose Quentin Young, a twenty-two-year-old Chinese explorer as unconventional as she was, who would join her in a romance as torrid as it was taboo.<br><br>Traveling across some of the toughest terrain in the world&#x2013;nearly impenetrable bamboo forests, slick and perilous mountain slopes, and boulder-strewn passages&#x2013;the team raced against a traitorous rival, and was constantly threatened by hordes of bandits and hostile natives. The voyage took months to complete and cost Ruth everything she had. But when, almost miraculously, she returned from her journey with a baby panda named Su Lin in her arms, the story became an international sensation and made the front pages of newspapers around the world. No animal in history had gotten such attention. And Ruth Harkness became a hero. <br><br>Drawing extensively on American and Chinese sources, including diaries, scores of interviews, and previously unseen intimate letters from Ruth Harkness, Vicki Constantine Croke has fashioned a captivating and richly textured narrative about a woman ahead of her time. Part Myrna Loy, part Jane Goodall, by turns wisecracking and poetic, practical and spiritual, Ruth Harkness is a trailblazing figure. And her story makes for an unforgettable, deeply moving adventure.</p><p><b>Vicki Constantine Croke</b> has been exploring animal life for more than two decades&#x2014;tracking the fossa in Madagascar, polar bears in the Arctic Circle, and Tasmanian devils in, of course, Tasmania.

He was dying, and alone in his agony. His original expedition mates, four adventurous men with dreams of capturing the giant panda, had all deserted him long before. Though he knew people in the city from previous trips and more recent escapades in notorious nightclubs and bars, in the end he had stayed true to some deeper nature, pushing them all away and stealing off in secret. His family, including his young wife back in Manhattan, had no idea he was even sick. With what little strength he could summon, he had been writing sunny notes home that masked his horrible condition. Perhaps he really believed his own words, for just weeks earlier he had been pressuring the doctor to release him so he could get back to his campaign. But, finally, on this frigid night, scarred by other attempts to scalpel tumors from his neck and torso and wretched from his latest incision, he found himself unable to eat or drink, then even to breathe. The sportsman who lived to rough it in the wild died under starched white sheets, in a ward reeking of antiseptic. His young life had ended in the pursuit of the most mysterious animal of his time, yet he had never managed to set a laced boot in the great snow-covered mountains that separated China and Tibet.<br><br>A world away, back in the noise and lights and rush of Manhattan, it had been an even chillier winter, one of the snowiest and coldest anyone could remember. Late in the afternoon, on the very day her husband took his last breath, Ruth Harkness was making her way home from a salon where she had enjoyed a luxurious shampoo. Bundled up, she happily picked her way along icy sidewalks that were dusted with ash for traction and walled in by freshly shoveled snow. Friends were due for cocktails shortly, and in the larger scheme of things, she had even more to look forward to. Now that things were beginning to go well for Bill, she thought, he might just be home within months. Then the two of them could travel the world as they had always imagined.<br><br>But as she stepped inside her comfortable West Side apartment, before she had time to hang up her coat, her &#x201c;pretty little mulatto maid&#x201d; and her houseguest, Margaret Freeland, confronted her with the horrible news: Bill was dead. A cable message had been relayed by telephone.<br><br>Her first reaction was stunned disbelief. It was too awful to accept. This must be some fantasy of the press&#x2014;reporters were fascinated by Bill and the other men of high adventure, but in their hunger for sensational stories, they were always getting things wrong. It had to be one of those false bulletins. Surely, over the course of the afternoon, that would become clear.<br><br>So she waited, as the winter darkness descended and lamps inside the apartment were snapped on. But hours later a telegram from Secretary of State Cordell Hull made it official. The love of her life was gone.<br><br>The devastation of that loss would consume her for weeks, and haunt her always. &#x201c;Do you have that tremendous necessity of needing one person,&#x201d; Ruth Harkness would ask a friend in the bruised aftermath of Bill&#x2019;s death, &#x201c;some person who understands you and trusts you completely in everything you do and you are&#x2014;and ever can or will be? Someone with whom you can let down all barriers? All pretense of any kind and still be liked or loved? . . . That is what Bill meant to me and in return I gave him what he needed.&#x201d;<br><br>Through their ten years together, few understood the singular nature of their bond. To the outside world, Ruth and Bill were opposites. But they were also as perfect a fit.<br><br>Both had arrived in Manhattan in their early twenties. It was the Jazz Age, when under the cover of darkness, whites began slipping into Harlem for the music. People spoke openly of birth control, and women were enticed by the makers of Chesterfield cigarettes to &#x201c;blow some my way.&#x201d; Josephine Baker had her own nightclub in Paris. Films turned talkie. Lindbergh crossed the Atlantic. D. H. Lawrence imagined a scandalous dalliance in Lady Chatterley&#x2019;s Lover, and Margaret Mead was discussing sex among young Samoans. It was the birth of Time magazine, The New Yorker, and the Milky Way bar. For young party-minded Manhattanites during Prohibition, speakeasies were all the rage. It was no surprise, then, that the worlds of two hell-raisers would eventually collide.<br><br>Handsome, short, and slender, with slicked-back straw-colored hair and light blue eyes, William Harvest Harkness, Jr., was born to privilege. The sound of his name alone declared it. He was not a member of the famous Standard Oil Harknesses. But Bill had graduated from Harvard, class of 1924; he was a rich boy whose name showed up in the society pages, the son of a successful New York City attorney, and the scion of a wealthy New York family, as the press described him. The Harknesses were powerfully connected and accustomed to doors being opened for them.<br><br>But those points alone certainly would not have been enough to attract Ruth. Bill Harkness also had grit, and smarts, and a wry take on the world. Never arrogant, he was nonetheless sure of himself, and unconcerned with proving anything to others. His singular nature defied easy definition. As one friend pointed out, Bill had &#x201c;inherited the wiry toughness of his Scotch-Irish ancestry along with a lot of mysticism, anomalously mixed with hard-headed Yankee shrewdness.&#x201d;<br><br>Both bookish and athletic, cynical and sensitive, Bill Harkness was a man of appealing contradictions. His complicatedness was something that Ruth would love.<br><br>In Ruth, Bill saw a novel act. She was nothing like the girls he had met at Harvard dances. With her black hair parted in the middle and pulled severely back, a penchant for the dramatic, even exotic, in her dress, and a fondness for bright red lipstick, Ruth Elizabeth McCombs stood out. She was a newly minted dress designer who possessed a rare polish and poise. Speaking with a cultured lilt, she had a deep voice and a light wit. She could fill a room with her presence, her outsized personality invariably prompting people to say that she was tall, even though she stood only five feet four. She had, according to one society watcher, &#x201c;that quality which Hollywood chooses to call glamour.&#x201d; Over the years, her panache would carry her through lofty circles in New York City and beyond, bringing her top-notch invitations wherever she went. She appeared the ultimate city slicker but had started life as anything but.<br><br>Born on September 21, 1900, the third of four children, she came from hardworking, frugal stock in Titusville, Pennsylvania, with American roots going back to the eighteenth century. Her father, Robert, was a carpenter, lean, fit, and kind. Her mother, Mary Anne Patterson McCombs, was a bit bulky and more than a bit stern. A stay-at-home seamstress, she was as old-fashioned as the long skirts she wore. The McCombses lived comfortably, in a big brown two-story house that was more sturdy than fancy. It symbolized the McCombs way of life: solid and straightforward. The land, blessed by a nearby creek, dotted with fragrant apple trees, and able to accommodate a small kitchen garden, had been in the family for generations. Robert had been born on the very site where the big house now stood, in a log cabin, in 1872.<br><br>Though not poor, the McCombses were far from wealthy. And Titusville knew wealth&#x2014;oil money, in fact. The nation&#x2019;s first commercially productive oil well had been drilled there, propelling a few families into an elite circle. They wintered in warm places and sent their children to private school. Their mansions were huge and ornate. But in the small-town culture, rich mixed easily with poor, and Ruth gained an intimacy with affluence, forever finding herself both repelled by and attracted to the rarefied world of the rich.<br><br>No matter where she went in life, she would always carry with her a number of family traits. Chief among them were resolve and stoicism. The hardscrabble McCombses were people who picked themselves up and dusted themselves off. Honesty was the number-one commandment. The family strengths were timeless, but to Ruth, it could also seem that her parents were hopelessly mired in the last century.<br><br>Chafing at the crabbed environment at home, where liquor and religion were shunned in equal measure, she found refuge in books, which took her to the far corners of the world. But even the family&#x2019;s temporary move to nearby Erie could not relieve the claustrophobia that she had begun to experience in Titusville. It was a pensive Ruth McCombs who looked out from the city&#x2019;s 1918 high school yearbook. Her entry, unlike the chirpy and chummy ones of her fellow students, read, &#x201c;Ruth is rather hard to get acquainted with, but after you know her you find that she has many good qualities and is a friend worth having.&#x201d; If few people in northwest Pennsylvania really understood her, that was fine by Ruth. Like her older siblings, Jim and Helen, she planned to cut loose at the first possible opportunity.<br><br>After a semester at the University of Colorado and an experiment teaching English in Cuba, Ruth, with twenty-five dollars as her war chest, headed north to New York City.<br><br>Raven-haired and slim, Ruth Elizabeth McCombs was twenty-three years old when she first remade herself. Powdered and dressed up, she took on Manhattan, finding a job in fashion, where she could design and sew dresses for a population that bought up all the Paris knockoffs Seventh Avenue could produce. She took to her new life like a natural&#x2014;utterly at ease at the center of a party, rarely seen without a smoke in one hand and a highball in the other. She became as quintessential a flapper as Clara Bow, one of the brassy, fun-loving girls in shimmering cocktail dresses who were, in the words of F. Scott Fitzgerald, &#x201c;impudent&#x201d; and &#x201c;hard-berled,&#x201d; who flouted convention and danced with abandon. Ruth said there were only two things in the world she hated: going to bed at night and getting up in the morning.<br><br>She might have been in great demand, but it wasn&#x2019;t because she was pretty (she always said her face was not her fortune, and that it took an expensive photographer to bring out her best). She was so striking, though, that when she walked into a room, men noticed, and Bill Harkness was no exception.<br><br>It didn&#x2019;t matter that she came from working folks in a small town, and he from big-city upper crusters. It meant nothing that she &#x201c;had to work like the devil for a bare living,&#x201d; and that he maintained his comfort without a thought to employment. He was intrigued.<br><br>Together, they knew how to enjoy themselves, to kick up their heels at naughty, high-toned soir�es and low-down speakeasies alike. During the postwar era of sexual freedom, the two bohemians became a full-fledged couple. They were as good as married, without the traditional, stodgy sanctity of a wedding. Neither was a prude, and both loved physical pleasure. Ruth even joked about scandalous notions like being spanked on &#x201c;a bare derriere.&#x201d;<br><br>At the beginning of their courtship, they found themselves constantly tucked away in some corner, slugging back bootleg booze and lost in intense conversation. Addicted to reading, they soon began swapping books on their favorite subject&#x2014;exotic travel. Their leather-bound volumes were filled with high adventure and glimpses of strange cultures. Often they contained delicate fold-out maps shaded in beautiful colors, veined with blue rivers and dappled by the shadowy wrinkles of mountain ranges. The most captivating among these atlases were the half-finished ones, those in which the dense, busy portions would end abruptly, leaving blank whole uncharted territories&#x2014;regions of the world still steeped in mystery. Here were the places that had not given up their secrets to Western travelers and mapmakers. Sitting together in the haze of cigarette smoke, warmed by a glass of whiskey, their imaginations racing, Bill and Ruth always found themselves drawn to those patches of the unknown.<br><br>Bill had spent most of his short adulthood &#x201c;on game trails in remote corners of the globe,&#x201d; Ruth said, visiting India and China, Java, Borneo, and other islands of the Dutch East Indies. He thrived on the rough-and-tumble life in the field leavened by stints of footloose merriment in exotic cities. In long letters home, and then in intimate getting-reacquainted sessions on his return, he entranced Ruth with his tales of treks abroad.<br><br>His accounts, no doubt, were as gracefully told as the sagas the couple read together. For Bill was the romantically literary type with a classical education. He had passed college-entrance examinations in Latin, Greek, French, English, and ancient history. He described himself as an author and a man of letters and was an American intellectual in the mold of Teddy Roosevelt&#x2014;the brave outdoorsman, as familiar with Milton as with a &#x201c;Big Medicine&#x201d; .405 rifle.<br><br>He and Ruth spent weekends at his family&#x2019;s estate in Connecticut, and sometimes slipped off for tropical romantic getaways to places like the Virgin Islands. They drank and philosophized. &#x201c;A dash of absinthe,&#x201d; Ruth said, &#x201c;and you analyze the hell out of everything.&#x201d; They read books, walked on the beach, and poured their hearts out to each other.<br><br>And there was so much to talk about. Each of them was haunted by a penetrating, persistent loneliness, suffering bouts of it even in a crowded room. Yet they craved solitude. To Bill and to Ruth, being alone was a complex state: the satisfaction of solitude played against a chronic sense of loneliness.<br><br>As they settled into a life together, and even after they were married, their rather elastic relationship was marked by intimacy and long periods of separation. Paradoxically, they seemed to grow closer while apart. When traveling, Bill found he could be utterly open with Ruth. In addressing her, he wrote more easily, and with greater clarity, than when scribbling in a private journal. Her intuition, her understanding of his very nature, was so complete, that just placing her name at the top of the page, he said, drew him out. He was so certain of a mystical connection between them that he never worried about how they would keep in touch despite the vagaries of international mail service and the fluid nature of his itineraries. &#x201c;He had a divine faith,&#x201d; Ruth explained, &#x201c;that I&#x2019;d somehow know how to get letters to him and strangely enough I did.&#x201d;<br><br>Her responses were encyclopedic. She couldn&#x2019;t help &#x201c;rambling&#x201d;&#x2014;telling him every detail of her activities and thoughts.<br><br>For Ruth, who would always feel that her family misunderstood her, there was, in this distant intimacy, a familiarity. She was accustomed to physical and emotional separations, and as Bill continued a life constantly on the campaign, his presence was a palpable part of her life.</p><h2>The Girl Before</h2><p><b>In this powerful psychological suspense debut, when a woman&#x2019;s life is shattered, she is faced with a devastating question: What if everything she thought was normal and good and true...wasn&#x2019;t?<br></b><br> Clara Lawson is torn from her life in an instant. Without warning, her home is invaded by armed men, and she finds herself separated from her beloved husband and daughters. The last thing her husband yells to her is to <i>say nothing</i>.<br><br> In chapters that alternate between past and present, the novel slowly unpeels the layers of Clara&#x2019;s fractured life. We see her growing up, raised with her sisters by the stern Mama and Papa G, becoming a poised and educated young woman, falling desperately in love with the forbidden son of her adoptive parents. We see her now, sequestered in an institution, questioned by men and women who call her a different name&#x2014;Diana&#x2014;and who accuse her husband of unspeakable crimes. As recollections of her past collide with new revelations, Clara must question everything she thought she knew, to come to terms with the truth of her history and to summon the strength to navigate her future.</p><p><b>Rena Olsen</b> grew up moving around every few years, following her minister father from church to church, and her exposure to so many different people and environments sparked an interest in human nature.

The sound of gunfire and men shouting and children screaming comes in a tidal wave through the open door. Dropping the brush, I grab Daisy&#x2019;s hand and pull her into the nearest closet, fumbling for the lever that will open the false back. We huddle in the small space together, and Daisy trembles in my arms. </p><p>Daisy cries as the door to the closet opens. I put a hand over her mouth to muffle the sound. Our hiding spot is clever, but not clever enough. Someone taps on the wall. &#x201c;This is hollow!&#x201d; he shouts, and his hands make shuffling sounds as they grope for a way in. It only takes a few minutes before the latch is discovered and we are revealed. Daisy screams and buries her face in my chest. I shield my eyes from the sudden brightness, swinging out with my other arm and coming into contact with hard flesh.</p><p>&#x201c;Whoa, there,&#x201d; a gentle voice says. I peek at the source, and see a man with kind eyes. I know it is a trick. How could he be kind when he has broken into our home? I lash out again, and he catches my arm. &#x201c;A little help here!&#x201d; he calls over his shoulder. His grip is firm, and I cannot retrieve my arm from his grasp. I wrap my other arm tightly around a sobbing Daisy and glare up at him.</p><p>The man is dressed in black from head to toe, a large gun strapped across his back. A woman pops up behind the man, her hair pulled back in a tight bun. She does not look as kind as he does, but she speaks in a quiet voice, holding her hands out in front of her. </p><p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not going to hurt you, sweetheart,&#x201d; she coos, and I roll my eyes. I am nobody&#x2019;s sweetheart. &#x201c;Just come out here so we can talk.&#x201d;</p><p>I want to protest, but I don&#x2019;t have many options. The man with the kind eyes tugs on my arm, and reluctantly I stand, pulling Daisy to her feet with me. She clings to my skirt, trying to disappear into the folds. Daisy has only been with us a few months, but we have already bonded. Daisy isn&#x2019;t her real name. I don&#x2019;t know what her real name is. When Glen brought her to me, he handed me a bouquet of fresh cut daisies. It seemed fitting. She is like my own daughter. </p><p>We emerge into the kitchen, and I sit at the same table as before. I place Daisy in front of me, retrieve the hairbrush from the floor, and resume brushing. Daisy sucks her thumb, but I do not scold her, even though we broke that habit two months ago. </p><p>&#x201c;What is your name?&#x201d; the woman asks, sitting across from me. </p><p>Brush, brush, brush. Long strokes through Daisy&#x2019;s cornsilk hair. It is almost halfway down her back now. Sometimes we go out and make dandelion crowns and she looks just like a princess. She wears those crowns until they are completely wilted.</p><p>The woman is still staring at me. &#x201c;My name is Meredith,&#x201d; she says. &#x201c;And this is Connor.&#x201d; She gestures toward the man. &#x201c;Can you tell me your name?&#x201d;</p><p>Can I? Certainly. I bite my lip, wishing for guidance. As if by divine intervention, there is a commotion from the back door, and Glen bursts through. His arms are pinned behind his back, and he is surrounded by men dressed in black. He sees me and his eyes widen.</p><p>&#x201c;Say <i>nothing</i>, baby, okay? Don&#x2019;t tell them anything.&#x201d; He continues to shout as the men wrestle him towards the front of the cabin. &#x201c;I love you, baby! Remember that!&#x201d;</p><p>I blush at his declaration in front of these strangers. The man and woman interrogating me look at me with odd expressions. </p><p>&#x201c;Is that your husband?&#x201d; the man asks.</p><p>Brush, brush, brush.</p><p>&#x201c;How long have you been here?&#x201d; the woman wants to know.</p><p>The strands sift through my fingers.</p><p>The man&#x2019;s eyes narrow. He looks as if he is concentrating very hard on putting a puzzle together. I see the moment he comes to his solution.</p><p>&#x201c;Is your name Diana?&#x201d;</p><p>Yank. The brush catches on a tangle and crashes to the floor. Daisy yelps.</p><p>&#x201c;Who is Diana?&#x201d; My first words. My only words.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Clara! That damn baby is crying again!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am woken by Glen&#x2019;s yell. Our newest addition, whom I have christened Jewel, whimpers quietly from the floor. She has been having nightmares, so I brought her into our room to be closer. Glen grumbled about it at first, but his chest soon rose and fell with his deep heavy sleep breathing. He tends to overreact sometimes.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, I slip out of the bed and stretch out on the floor next to the fitful child. She is not yet four, with dark ringlets and bright green eyes. She is quiet, but in unguarded moments, her smile could light an entire city.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As soon as I reach Jewel, she relaxes, and curls into me. I stroke her soft curls, murmuring nonsense words of comfort. She should sleep through the night now. She never has more than one nightmare. I tell this to Glen, who has come to stand over us. He nods, then gathers Jewel into his arms. He can be so gentle when he chooses to be. He leaves to bring Jewel back to her room.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am already in bed when Glen returns. He climbs under the covers and reaches for me. His stubble scrapes along my skin and his breath has already turned sour in the night, but it is comforting and familiar. It is Glen. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It has been three days since I have been taken. I lie on my narrow cot and try not to fidget with the scratchy gown they have given me to wear. I want to ask what will become of all my beautiful things, but that would involve talking, and I must not talk. Glen told me to <i>say nothing</i>. I slipped up once when the man asked about Diana, and I forgot for a moment that I wasn&#x2019;t to speak. The man began an explanation, but I tuned him out. I didn&#x2019;t want to hear. I only wanted to see Glen again, but he was gone.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They brought us out to the front driveway and ushered us into the backseats of the many cars cluttering the space. The children tried to run to me, but were held back. They let me keep a hold of Daisy, but wanted my hairbrush. &#x201c;Evidence,&#x201d; they said. I don&#x2019;t know what a hairbrush is supposed to tell them, but I gave it to them anyway. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They pulled up in front of a brick building and took Daisy. She cried and reached for me, and I whispered, &#x201c;Be strong, be brave,&#x201d; in her ear. I don&#x2019;t think Glen would have minded that. It didn&#x2019;t really count anyway, since none of the uniformed men and women heard it. I was brought to another building, stripped and bathed, and left in this room. Three times a day they bring food, which I have not touched. It smells like antiseptic, and the wail of ambulances keeps me up at night. Once a day they bring me into a room with a table and three chairs, and sit across from me, trying to get me to talk. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I won&#x2019;t talk.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a toilet in the corner of the room, but I only use it when I am sure it is nighttime. I only know it is nighttime because they turn the lights from dim to dimmer. There are no windows here. They say it is not jail. It is a hospital. They are only holding me here &#x201c;for now.&#x201d; They want to help me.</p><p>I will rot in this room before I tell them anything.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Then</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No peeking!&#x201d; Glen is acting like an excited schoolboy. He has driven me hours out of the city, blindfolded the whole way. He has a surprise for me, and doesn&#x2019;t want to ruin it. I can smell the fresh air, and know we must be far away from the pollution-filled city. Glen helps me down from the front seat of his truck, and my feet crunch on gravel as they land. &#x201c;Just a little further,&#x201d; Glen says, sounding absolutely giddy.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He comes to stand behind me and whips off the blindfold. &#x201c;Ta-da!&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am standing in front of the largest log cabin I have ever seen. We are surrounded by a forest of evergreens, and I hear water rushing in the distance.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Glen,&#x201d; I breathe. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s beautiful!&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His face breaks out in a wide grin. &#x201c;Come see the rest of it!&#x201d; He pulls me forward toward the large porch that wraps around both sides of the house. Double doors lead into a giant foyer. There are separate staircases leading to opposite wings of the house, but what catches my eye is the wall of floor-to-ceiling windows on the other end of the house. The Rocky Mountains look beautiful, like a postcard, and I am in love.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What is it for?&#x201d; I ask, my voice hesitant. Sometimes Glen likes to play jokes. I cross my fingers behind my back that this is not one of his silly pranks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;For us, baby,&#x201d; Glen says, coming forward to wrap his arms around me. He kisses my nose. &#x201c;For us and the children.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I look around. &#x201c;All of us?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glen laughs and leads me to the window. Down the sloping lawn I see a cluster of smaller cabins. &#x201c;The guys will live there. The children will live here. The house already has plenty of spaces for safe rooms. It won&#x2019;t need too much work.&#x201d; It doesn&#x2019;t surprise me that Glen has already thought of this. He has become obsessed with ways to keep us safe over the past few months. From whom, I&#x2019;m not sure, but we practice what to do in case of a threat each time a new girl joins our family. &#x201c;And over that way,&#x201d; Glen continues, gesturing beyond the tree line, &#x201c;there is more land we can use to expand.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He has a point. Right now our apartment feels like it will burst. A small bit of hope blooms in my chest. Here, with so much room to spread out, there will be plenty of room for our daughters. Maybe here, in the fresh air, nestled among the trees, things will be different.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Glen watches me, eyes shining as he waits for my response. I haven&#x2019;t seen him this excited since Papa G passed last year. The stress of taking over for his father has weighed on Glen, and with this house, that weight seems to have lifted.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I love it,&#x201d; I gush, spinning in a circle to take it all in. Glen catches me by the waist and lifts me high. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Really? Do you really like it?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s the best house I&#x2019;ve ever seen,&#x201d; I sigh as he sets me down, keeping me within the safe circle of his arms. &#x201c;But can we afford it?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Something flashes in Glen&#x2019;s eyes. I recognize that look. I have crossed the line. His arms tighten and I flinch. Glen closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and when he opens them they are clear once again. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need to worry about that, do you, baby?&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I shake my head, clamping my mouth shut. I got caught up in the moment and the idea that he wanted my opinion on the house. I only need to know what Glen tells me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Now</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The metal chair is hard beneath me. I wish they would give me pants to wear with my medical gown when they make me leave my room. Or a coat. It is always freezing. The paper slippers I have been granted do little to warm my toes. I sip the lukewarm water in front of me. Water is the only concession I make. I have not eaten in four days. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meredith sits across from me, her ever-calm fa�ade in place. Connor paces behind her, suit jacket off, tie loosened. They look different than they did when they came to the cabin. More formal, but less scary. </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Diana, it is very important that you cooperate with us.&#x201d;</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They keep calling me Diana. But I am not Diana. They are confused. This entire thing is one ridiculous mistake. They think I am Diana, and they think Glen is a criminal. I usually stop listening when they talk about his crimes. I will not listen to lies.</p><p>I know that the table has five hundred ninety-two scratches in it. Five hundred ninety-seven now, since I have made some new ones. When Connor paces, he walks eight steps in one direction, pivots, and walks eight steps in the other direction. The clock ticks steadily until seven minutes before the hour, then it starts clicking and moving backwards. At two minutes to the hour, it buzzes and returns to its normal rhythm. Meredith always tenses up when it begins clicking, and I get secret enjoyment out of watching her squirm. </p><p>&#x201c;Glen has been talking about you, Diana.&#x201d; This statement catches my attention as I am trying to figure the best way to count the ceiling tiles. &#x201c;He calls you Clara. Do you want to know what he says about you?&#x201d;</p><p>I do. Desperately. But I only stare at Meredith. <i>&#x201c;Say nothing.&#x201d;</i> Glen&#x2019;s words echo in my head. Why is he allowed to talk and I am not? Then, Glen is allowed to do many things I am not. I fidget as I imagine his reaction to my thoughts. A few days away and I am getting myself into trouble again. I remind myself that Glen cannot hear my thoughts, though at times it seems he can. Glen knows me better than anyone else.</p><p>&#x201c;He says you are innocent, Diana.&#x201d; Meredith pauses. &#x201c;Would you rather I call you Clara for now?&#x201d; She asks this as if it is only just occurring to her, but I am familiar with this trick. Glen uses it often. She is pretending to be nice, expecting me to break if she shows me kindness. Trying to get me to drop my guard. I narrow my eyes at her. I am on to her. She will not get me to talk.</p><p>&#x201c;Clara.&#x201d; Connor has come to the table. He sits next to Meredith. &#x201c;Glen doesn&#x2019;t want you to be in trouble. He wants us to let you go. But before we can do that, you have to talk to us. Can you do that, Clara?&#x201d;</p><p>Does Glen really want me to talk to them? Or are they just trying to make it seem that way?

Interweaving his memories of boyhood Christmases in the dark days of the Depression and the details of present-day holidays with his grandchildren, Ferrol Sams demonstrates the deep, inescapable role of rituals in our lives and the importance of passing them on to each succeeding generation. Rich with details as true today as they were more than a half-century ago when Sams was growing up, Christmas Gift! is a grandfather&#39;s loving preservation of an important ritual of his childhood. Strapped for material resources adequate to their generous spirits, members of the Sams household would greet each other with the joyous cry of &#34;Christmas gift!&#34; in order to share the tidings of the season and celebrate their connection.

In this no-holds-barred memoir, legendary rocker Danny Seraphine shares his dramatic&#x2014;and often shocking&#x2014;experiences as the popular supergroup's cofounder and longtime drummer. He reveals behind-the-scenes anecdotes about Chicago&#x2019;s beginnings as the house band at Los Angeles's legendary Whisky A Go Go, where they were discovered by music icons Janis Joplin and Jimi Hendrix, and personal insights about the group&#x2019;s many comebacks and reinventions over the years.</p><ul><li>Offers a lively inside account of the music and history of the perennially popular band Chicago, one of the most successful American bands ever with over 122 million albums sold, by the band&#x2019;s cofounder and longtime drummer Danny Seraphine </li><li>Includes riveting tales and rare photographs from Seraphine's time on the road touring with performers including Dennis and Carl Wilson of the Beach Boys, Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, and Bruce Springsteen </li><li>Candidly tackles many rumors about Chicago, including Mafia ties, accounting and payola scandals, and major drug abuse </li><li>Discusses the mysterious circumstances surrounding Seraphine's 1990 firing from the band as well as his comeback with his critically acclaimed new band, California Transit Authority </li></ul><p>Whether you're a diehard Chicago fan or just love a well-told rock-and-roll memoir, <i>Street Player</i> will entertain and surprise you.</p></p><p><p>In Street Player, legendary drummer Danny Seraphine, a founding member of the iconic band Chicago, tells the dramatic story of his rise from the very mean streets of Chicago to the pinnacle of rock fame and fortune in the 1960s, a watershed period in music history. In this riveting book, Seraphine offers vivid portraits of his fellow band members and reveals how Chicago differs from all other bands and why they have captured the hearts of millions of fans worldwide.</p><p></p><p>This lively inside story is filled with fascinating and colorful tales from Seraphine's time on the road. He recalls how his first meeting with Janis Joplin nearly turned into a fist fight (and how she sweetly apologized afterward), why Jimi Hendrix invited Chicago to tour with him, and how Hendrix, a former paratrooper, calmly reassured him during a very turbulent flight. He talks about touring with the Beach Boys, Bruce Springsteen, Led Zeppelin, and other music legends. Seraphine's tales of learning and perfecting his craft, and of how he pushed his and the band's art to their limits and beyond, are told with an unforgettable passion and urgency.</p><p>Seraphine shares moving and heartfelt stories of his life. For example, in the winter of 1965, as a high school dropout, he stood alone in his mother's kitchen wondering what had happened to his dream. He had thought he would be a professional drummer by then, basking in the roar of applause and well on his way to a brilliant career. Instead, he could hear only echoes of the shotgun blast that nearly took his life the night before. He imagined a pointless future of street fights and felonies in which the best he could hope for was a low-level position in the Chicago Mafia. Knowing there was no way out, he was close to despair. Then the phone rang; the rest is music history. </p><p>And in this book, for the first time, Seraphine tells the painful story, from the heart, of close friend and cofounder Terry Kath's death and of Seraphine's traumatic 1990 firing from the band and the pain that he has only recently overcome.</p><p>Complete with dozens of photos from Chicago's early years, Street Player is an uncommonly powerful rock memoir that is easy to pick up and very hard to put down.</p><p>Chicago has thrilled music fans for more than forty years with their musical and lyrical brilliance. In this no-holds-barred </p><p>memoir, legendary rocker Danny Seraphine shares his </p><p>dramatic&#x2014;and often shocking&#x2014;experiences as the </p><p>supergroup's cofounder and longtime drummer.

But Bibi, as he is known by friend and foe alike, is no stranger to controversy. For many in Israel and elsewhere, he is an embarrassment, a threat to democracy, even a precursor to Donald Trump. He nevertheless continues to dominate Israeli public life--and he may yet survive his current crises, the most challenging of his career. How can we explain Netanyahu's rise, his hold on Israeli politics, and his outsized role on the world's stage?<br><br>In <i>Bibi</i>, the Haaretz journalist Anshel Pfeffer argues that we must view Netanyahu as representing the triumph of the underdogs in the Zionist enterprise. Born in 1949, one year after the state of Israel itself, Netanyahu came of age in a nation dominated by liberal, secular Zionists. Yet Netanyahu's grandfather and father bequeathed to him a brand of Zionism integrating Jewish nationalism and religious traditionalism, and he identified with the groups at the margins of Israeli society: right-wing Revisionists, orthodox, Mizrahi Jews, and small-time professionals living in the new towns and cities dotting the Israeli landscape. Netanyahu cultivated each faction individually and then fused them into a coalition that has frequently proven unstoppable in Israeli politics.<br><br>Netanyahu is also a child of America, where he spent many years as a young man, and where he learned the techniques of modern political campaigns as well as the necessity of controlling the media cycle. The product of the affluent East Coast Jewish community and the Reagan era, Netanyahu's politics and worldview were formed as much by American Cold War conservatism as by his family's hardline right-wing Zionism.<br><br>As Pfeffer demonstrates in this penetrating biography, Netanyahu's influence will endure even if his career soon comes to an end. The Israel he has helped make is a hybrid of ancient phobia and high-tech hope, tribalism and globalism--just like the man himself.<br><br></p><p><b>Anshel Pfeffer</b> has covered Israeli politics and global affairs for two decades. He is a senior correspondent and columnist for <i>Haaretz </i>and the Israel correspondent for the <i>Economist.</i> He lives in Jerusalem."Superbly timed...insightful...Pfeffer is one of the smartest and most prolific of Israel's younger generation of journalists...Bibi, obsessed by hostile 'left-wing media,' complained preemptively that this biography would be a cartoon. It is not: it fleshes out a superficially familiar and invariably quotable figure with a wealth of background information and analysis that provide necessary and, of course, often highly critical context...This book is a necessary contribution to understanding a high-profile and internationally contentious figure and the fractured country he has led for so long."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Ian Black, <i>New York Times </i></b></i></b><br><br>"[Pfeffer is] one of Israel's best informed writers...[<i>Bibi</i> is] a must read for everyone who is interested in the undercurrents of today's Israeli society"&#x2015;<b>Tom Segev</b>, <b><i><i><b>Economist </b></i></i></b><br><br>"Readers who are rooting either for or against Netanyahu will find that Pfeffer's reporting quenches their thirst for the complete picture of his rise to power."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Commentary</i></b></i></b><br><br>"A perceptive history of a beleaguered nation and one deeply flawed leader."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus Reviews</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Weaving together stories from Netanyahu's time in America and Israel, and from his family history, military service, and political career, Anshel Pfeffer's fascinating and insightful <i>Bibi</i> paints a portrait of the indomitable outsider who became Israel's three-time prime minister. Pfeffer's riveting account illuminates the ways in which the man leading Israel today is both a product and a beneficiary of bitter divides that have shaped the nation's politics from its earliest days."&#x2015;<b>Tamara Cofman Wittes, Senior Fellow in Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution</b><br><br>"In a career that could yet make him the longest serving Prime Minister in Israel's history, Benjamin Netanyahu turned out to be much more than the temporary speed bump in Israeli politics his critics once imagined. In this lively and trenchant biography, Anshel Pfeffer explains why and how Bibi came to dominate and embody the changing face of the remarkable and divided nation he still leads."&#x2015;<b>Aaron David Miller, Vice-President and Middle East Program Director at the Woodrow Wilson Center</b><br><br>"Certain to elicit both consternation and praise, Anshel Pfeffer's <i>Bibi: The Turbulent Life and Times of Benjamin Netanyahu</i> is a fascinating exploration of the complex ideological and familial foundations that continue to shape the thinking and governing of the man who may soon become Israel's longest serving Prime Minster. This is a book that will lead both Bibi's friends as well as his foes to see him a new--and infinitely more nuanced--light."&#x2015;<b>Daniel Gordis</b>, <b><i><b>author of <i>Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn </i></b></i></b><br><br>"Anshel Pfeffer has done something hard to do. He's given us an understanding, even compassionate, portrait of Benjamin Netanyahu--the family, the formative experiences, the logic of his belligerent ideology--while keeping his distance from Netanyahu's stances and exposing many of the unpleasant truths that lie beneath the surface Netanyahu works so hard to polish.

"Are you sure this bandido is the same man who murdered Tonio four years ago?" she asked Cruz.<br><br>"The same."<br><br>"Antonio Guerrero was a traitor and a fool!" Alejandro snarled. "If I had not shot him, the Texas Rangers would have hung him for plotting with the Mexican government to overthrow the Republic."<br><br>"You are going to hang, Alejandro. If not for murdering my brother, then for stealing my cattle and my horses and for raping the women of my pueblo," Cruz said.<br><br>The bandido's hostile eyes glittered in the darkened cell. "I admit to nothing--except that I enjoy the first tearing thrust into virgin flesh." He eyed Sloan and added, "You are not, it seems, nearly so fastidious, Don Cruz."<br><br>"Enough!" Cruz said from between clenched teeth.<br><br>Sloan unconsciously backed away from the bandido's malevolent stare until she felt Cruz's implacable strength behind her. She straightened her shoulders and said with outward calm, "I'm ready to leave. I've seen all I need to see."<br><br>Alejandro nodded his head in mock obeisance to her. "Adi-s, puta. Until we meet again."<br><br>Sloan recoiled from the cruel smile on Alejandro's sharpboned face. His pitiless eyes undressed her, exposing the full breasts with dusky nipples he would pinch and fondle, the slender waist and wide, child-bearing hips he would mount, the triangle of dark curls at the juncture of slim, strong legs that would grip his hairy thighs.<br><br>She closed her eyes to shut out his visual rape of her, but the sound of Alejandro's low, grating laugh forced them open again. She shivered as his eyes insolently skimmed her body one last time.<br><br>"I will not be here long enough to hang," he promised. "I will escape, as I escaped from the Rangers four years ago. And when I do, I will see for myself whether Antonio spoke the truth about his whore."<br><br>Sloan didn't wait to hear Cruz's response to the bandido's taunt. She left the dank room of tiny cells filled with frontier riffraff, murderers and thieves and walked outside onto San Antonio's dusty central square. She squinted her eyes against the sun's midday glare and leaned her hand against the rough brown adobe building, fighting the dizziness that overtook her.<br><br>She inhaled a deep breath of air to clear her nostrils of the stench of the jail. The smells outside were equally pungent, but not so offensive--frijoles cooking, a freshly laid pattern of horse dung, tiny wild roses climbing the adobe jail wall, and overlaying it all, the tangy smell of sweat from humans and horses.<br><br>Sloan froze as a rigid-backed Spanish woman passed by, tugging along a dark-haired little boy dressed in short pants. For an instant Sloan thought it was Cruz's mother Dona Lucia with Cisco--Sloan's now three-year-old son.<br><br>But it wasn't.<br><br>Sloan slumped back against the adobe wall, fearful her legs wouldn't support her, as memories of Tonio, of her pregnancy, and of the birth of her son came flooding back.<br><br>It was hard to remember why she had first been attracted to Antonio Guerrero, but she supposed it must have been his smile. It was charming and rakish and tilted up at one corner more than the other. Or it might have been his dark eyes sparkling with devilry that had captured her heart. But it was his voice to which she had succumbed, a voice that was low and smooth and coaxing in a way she hadn't been able to resist.<br><br>She had felt foolish when she realized she had fallen in love with Tonio. As the future heir to Three Oaks, she had been trained by Rip Stewart to make calm, rational decisions, and there was nothing the least bit calm or rational about falling head over heels in love. Especially when she had been raised from birth to understand that her destiny lay with Three Oaks--not as the wife of the younger son of a Spanish don.<br><br>She didn't dare admit her feelings to her father, for fear he'd think her clabber-headed. So she had kept her thoughts to herself. And made some terrible mistakes.<br><br>Sloan picked at a callus on the palm of her hand. Tonio hadn't liked her hands, she remembered. She held them out in front of her and looked at them. Raising cotton was dirty work. Her fingernails were broken to the quick, and not a little grimy. Calluses adorned her fingertips and the palms of her hands. They were small hands, but there was nothing dainty about them, she thought with a grimace.<br><br>Yet she had full breasts and hips, a shape a man might admire if he could ever see beyond the planter's clothes she usually wore. Sloan glanced at her dusty Wellington boots, at her stained osnaburg trousers, at the visible ring of sweat at her armpits on the gingham shirt she wore, at the unraveling threads on the second button of her waistcoat, which had been nearly yanked off when it got caught on the cotton gin. Her lips curved in a rueful, self-deprecating grin. Right now she looked a mess!<br><br>She hadn't been near a mirror this morning, but she could imagine her face also showed signs of her hurried journey from Three Oaks to San Antonio. Her one vanity, her waist-length sable-brown hair, was tied at her nape in a single tail with a piece of crumpled ribbon that had once been pale yellow.<br><br>There was nothing about her normal working-day appearance to entice a man as handsome as Antonio Guerrero to fall in love with her. She should have realized from the beginning that he'd had other reasons for what he had said and done.<br><br>Sloan felt her stomach roil with the disgust she felt every time she thought of how the man she had loved had so coldly and calculatedly used that love to get from her what he had wanted.<br><br>She would have done anything for him. He had used her to further his sordid plot with the Mexican government to invade Texas, giving her secret messages to carry to his cohorts. She had done his bidding without questioning him, because she had loved and trusted him. How gullible she had been! How stupid!<br><br>It was hard to remember the initial joy she had felt at finding out she was pregnant with Tonio's child. Hard to remember the hours when she had pressed her hands against her belly and thought with wonder of their child growing within her. She should have realized something was wrong when Tonio did not immediately offer to marry her when she told him she was pregnant.<br><br>"We must wait, chiquita," he had said. "There will be time enough to marry and give the child a name."<br><br>Of course, he had never intended to marry her. It had been devastating to discover he was a traitor, that he had been murdered by one of his own men, Alejandro Sanchez, and that she must somehow bear all on her own the sorrow of his death, the shock of his betrayal and the shame of being pregnant and unwed.<br><br>It had not taken long for sorrow and shock and shame to become hate and anger and resolution. She had thought it out, weighing every detail, and made the only rational decision possible: She would not keep Tonio's child.<br><br>She was bitter and angry for what Tonio had done. She did not think she could love the child of such a man, or even maintain indifference to it. She was afraid she would blame the child for the sins of the father, and she feared the hateful emotions she felt whenever she thought of Tonio and the bastard child she was to bear him.<br><br>To spare the innocent child, she had sought out Tonio's elder brother, Cruz, and they had come to an agreement.<br><br>Sloan sighed and shook her head. She still could not believe she had acted as she had. She could only blame her actions on the turbulent emotions she had felt at the time. She could vividly recall the disbelieving look on Cruz's face when she told him what she wanted to do.<br><br>"You will give away your own child?" he had exclaimed in horror.<br><br>"It would bring back too many memories to keep Tonio's baby," she had replied.<br><br>"Surely in time the memories will fade," he had said, "and you will want your son or daughter--"<br><br>"I will never forget Tonio. Or what he--"<br><br>"You loved him, then," Cruz had said, his voice harsh.<br><br>"I did," she admitted. "More than my life," she finished in a whisper. That was what had made his betrayal so painful. It did not occur to her that Cruz would not realize her love for his brother had died with Tonio.<br><br>She had watched Cruz's lips flatten to a thin line, watched him frown as he came to his decision.<br><br>"Very well. I will take the child. But he must have a name."<br><br>"You may call him whatever you wish," she said, in a rush to have it all done and over.<br><br>"My brother's son must have his name."<br><br>"If you wish to call the child Antonio--"<br><br>"You misunderstand me," Cruz interrupted brusquely. "My family possesses a noble Spanish heritage. My brother's child must bear the Guerrero name."<br><br>Sloan had not imagined how difficult it was going to be to go through with her plan. She swallowed over the painful lump in her throat and said, "If you wish to adopt the child as your own, I will agree."<br><br>"That is not at all my intention," Cruz said.<br><br>She felt the warm touch of Cruz's fingers as he lifted her chin, forcing her to meet his gaze.<br><br>His blue eyes were dark with some emotion she refused to acknowledge. He could not feel that way about her, not when she had been his brother's woman. What she could not accept, she ignored.<br><br>His gaze held hers captive as he said, "My brother's child will bear the Guerrero name because you will be my wife."<br><br>"That's ridiculous," she blurted, pulling away from him.<br><br>"Not at all," he countered. "If you wish me to take the child and raise it as my own, you will marry me."<br><br>"That's blackmail! I won't do it."<br><br>"Then find another solution to your problem, Senorita Sloan."<br><br>The tall Spaniard had already turned on his booted heel before she found her voice. "Wait! There must be some way we can work this out."<br><br>He pivoted back to her, determination etched in his features. "I have stated my condition for taking the child."<br><br>His arrogance infuriated her, and she clasped her hands to keep herself from attacking him. She held her anger in check, knowing that however satisfying it would be to feel the skin of his cheek under her palm, it would be a useless gesture. She had nowhere else to turn.<br><br>"All right," she said. "I will marry you."<br><br>Before his triumphant smile had a chance to form fully, she continued, "But it will be a marriage in name only. I will not live with you."<br><br>"That is hardly a proper marriage, senorita."<br><br>She snorted. "I don't care a worm's worth about a proper marriage. I'm trying to find a way to compromise with you."<br><br>"As my wife, you will live with me," Cruz announced in a commanding voice.<br><br>"If I marry you, I'll live at Three Oaks," she retorted.<br><br>"Unfortunately, that would make it quite impossible for us to have the children I desire."<br><br>Sloan flushed. "I won't live with you."<br><br>"Then we can come to no agreement."<br><br>Once again, Sloan was forced to halt his departure. "Wait--"<br><br>"You agree, then?"<br><br>Sloan raked her mind for some way to put off the inevitable and came up with an idea. "I'll agree to marry you. But I'll live with you as your wife only after Alejandro Sanchez is brought to justice."<br><br>Cruz grimaced in frustration. "My brother's murderer may never be caught."<br><br>"I know," Sloan replied. "But that is my condition." She said it with the same intractability he had used when he laid down his own demands.<br><br>"I agree to your suggestion," Cruz said at last. "We will be married now, and I will take the child when it is born and raise it as my own. Ours will be a marriage in name only--until such time as Alejandro Sanchez shall be brought to justice."<br><br>It was obvious to Sloan when she shook hands with Cruz to seal their bargain that he expected to find Alejandro within days. But her luck had held. Alejandro had remained elusive, and she had remained at Three Oaks.<br><br>Over the years, while Cruz had hunted diligently for the bandido, he had kept their bargain and raised her son as his own. Now, at long last, Cruz had found Alejandro. Now, at long last, the arrogant Spaniard would expect her to fulfill her part of their bargain.<br><br>For reasons she could never explain to him, Sloan knew she could not do it.<br><br>She jumped away from the adobe wall as Cruz's voice startled her from her reverie.<br><br>"I should have killed him when I had the chance."<br><br>"The law will avenge Tonio's death," she said.<br><br>"Only if Alejandro is still in jail when the time comes to hang him."<br><br>A frisson of alarm skittered down Sloan's spine. "You don't seriously believe he can escape, do you? He's tied hand and foot, and he'll be guarded by Texas Rangers."<br><br>"He is treacherous and cunning. He must be clever to have stayed free this long. And there are those who would help him escape."<br><br>"But--"<br><br>Cruz thrust a restless hand through his thick black hair. "But, as you say, I am worrying needlessly. We will surely see him hang tomorrow."<br><br>"I won't be staying for the hanging," Sloan admitted. "I dropped everything and left in the middle of the cotton harvest when I got your message that Alejandro had been caught. My responsibilities as overseer can't wait. And I have enough nightmares to disturb my sleep without adding one more."</p><h2>Simply Good News: Why the Gospel is News and What Makes it Good</h2><p>At last!

The world is poised for social and political change, but England holds tight to its traditions, classes, and prejudices.<br> &nbsp;<br> When an explosion in London kills two policemen and seriously injures three more, many believe that anarchists are the culprits. But Thomas Pitt, commander of Special Branch, knows the city&#x2019;s radical groups well enough to suspect that someone with decidedly more personal motives lit the deadly fuse. As he investigates the source of the fatal blast, Pitt is stunned to discover that the bombing was a calculated strike against the ranks of law enforcement.<br> &nbsp;<br> But still more shocking revelations await, as Pitt&#x2019;s inquiries lead him to a member of Parliament hoping for a lucrative business deal, a high-ranking police officer with secrets to keep, and an aristocratic opium addict seeking murderous revenge. As he pursues each increasingly threatening lead, Pitt finds himself impeded at every turn by the barriers put in place to protect the rich and powerful&#x2014;barriers that, as they start to crumble, threaten to bury him alive.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Praise for Anne Perry&#x2019;s most recent Charlotte and Thomas Pitt novels</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b><i>The Angel Court Affair</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> &#x201c;Be prepared for another well-deserved vacation to Victorian London with Anne Perry as the most cunning tour guide you will ever need. . . .

The fire brigade had thoroughly hosed the small bursts of flame here and there, and the water had puddled on the floor and settled into the craters left by the bomb that had detonated approximately forty-�five minutes ago. It was midday but the sky was still clouded with smoke and the stench of it was everywhere.<br><br>Pitt moved out of the way as two ambulance men lifted a wounded man onto a makeshift litter and carried him out to the waiting ambulance. The horses were shifting their weight impatiently. They knew the smell of burning in the early winter air and each crash of collapsing timber startled them, though they waited obediently.<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s it, sir,&#x201d; the white-�faced constable said to Pitt, blinking rapidly. Perhaps it was the smoke that stung the man&#x2019;s eyes, but more probably it was emotion. All of the men who had been caught in the explosion were police: five of them altogether. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s the last of them out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; Pitt acknowledged the words. &#x201c;How many dead?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hobbs and Newman, sir. We didn&#x2019;t move the bodies.&#x201d; The constable coughed and tried to clear his throat. &#x201c;Ednam, Bossiney, and Yarcombe are pretty badly injured, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; Pitt repeated. His mind was teeming with thoughts, and yet he could not come up with anything to say that would give any real comfort to the constable. Pitt was head of Special Branch, that discreet part of Security that dealt with threats to the nation&#x2014;�sabotage, assassinations, bombings, any form of terrorism. He had seen destruction and violent death more times than he cared to remember. In fact, before Special Branch he had been in the regular police, dealing primarily with cases of murder.<br><br>But this was a deliberate attack directed specifically at the police: colleagues he had known and worked with over the years. He could remember Newman getting married, Hobbs&#x2019;s first promotion. Now he had to search this wreckage for their bodies.<br><br>He turned and started to move slowly, picking his way so as not to disturb what was left of the situation&#x2014;�the evidence, if it could be called such. They already knew it was a bomb blast. Two people had been close enough to witness it. They had heard the explosion and seen the rubble flying, and then the flames as the wood caught fire. Now they were sitting in the back of an ambulance as one of the drivers finished binding up a gash in an arm caused by flying glass. There were shards everywhere from exploded windows. Both of the witnesses looked battered and shocked, but Pitt would have to interview them.<br><br>He spoke to the man first. He looked to be in his sixties, white-�haired, dressed in a formal coat. Likely he had been on his way back home from church. There were cuts on the right side of his face, and a burn across his cheek, as if a piece of flaming wood had caught him. His right side was smeared with dust and there were small burns in the fabric of his clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;On my way home from church, God help us,&#x201d; the man said shakily after Pitt had introduced himself and apologized for disturbing him. &#x201c;What kind of people would do this?&#x201d; He was frightened, and trying desperately not to show it in front of the woman. His wife, Pitt assumed. He must have been walking on the outside, as a man would, and she had been closer to the blast and was more seriously hurt. It was her arm the ambulance man was binding.<br><br>&#x201c;Did you see anyone else in the street?&#x201d; Pitt asked. &#x201c;Anyone at all? Any witnesses might help.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No . . . no, I didn&#x2019;t. We were talking to each other,&#x201d; the man replied. &#x201c;Who would do this? What do they want?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, sir. But we&#x2019;ll find out,&#x201d; Pitt promised. The ambulance man caught Pitt&#x2019;s eye, his glance indicating that Pitt should hurry. Blood was already beginning to seep through the bandage on the woman&#x2019;s arm as he added another layer, and she looked pale.<br><br>Pitt handed his card to the man. He didn&#x2019;t see any point in delaying them further. &#x201c;Thank you. That&#x2019;s all for now. If you remember anything, please let us know.&#x201d; He wished them well, and with a nod to the ambulance man he walked back toward the house. It was time to go in and look at the bodies, gather whatever evidence there was.<br><br>He skirted around a block of fallen masonry, picking his way carefully. He could taste burning in the air, and yet it was cold.<br><br>&#x201c;Sir!&#x201d; a fireman called out. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t come in here! It&#x2019;s . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt kept on walking, his feet crunching on broken glass. &#x201c;Commander Pitt,&#x201d; he introduced himself.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh . . . well, watch where you put your feet, sir. And your head.&#x201d; He glanced upward at a broken beam that was hanging at a crazy angle, swaying a little, as if it could become detached and fall off any moment. &#x201c;You still shouldn&#x2019;t ought to be here,&#x201d; he added.<br><br>&#x201c;The dead men?&#x201d; Pitt requested.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s dangerous in here,&#x201d; the man pointed out. &#x201c;They&#x2019;ll not be going nowhere, sir. Best you let us get them out. The blast killed them, sir. No doubt about that.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt would have liked the excuse not to look at the bodies, but there was none. He might learn nothing useful, but it would be a beginning of facing the reality and coming to terms with it.<br><br>He was standing in front of the fireman. The man was pale-�faced, apart from the black ash smudges on his cheeks. His uniform was filthy, and wet. When he had time to think about it, he would realize he was cold as well.<br><br>&#x201c;The bodies?&#x201d; Pitt nudged him as gently as he could.<br><br>&#x201c;That way, sir,&#x201d; the man said reluctantly. &#x201c;But be careful. You&#x2019;d be best not to touch anything. Bring the whole lot down on top o&#x2019; yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Pitt responded, beginning the awkward journey, trying to avoid tripping. If he fell he would almost certainly bang into a jutting wall strut, a piece of smashed furniture, or something dangling from where the ceiling used to be.<br><br>The floorboards were half up, torn by the blast. It must have been a large bomb and, to judge by the burning and the angles of the broken wood, he was near the center of it. What on earth had happened here in the quiet house on a pleasant London street near Kensington Gardens? Anarchists? London was full of them. Half the revolutionaries in Europe had either lived here or passed through. In this year of 1898 there had been less terrorist activity than in the recent past, but now, almost at the close of the year, it seemed Special Branch&#x2019;s sense of ease was misplaced. Was this the dying blow, or the first outrider of another storm? Nihilists in Europe had assassinated President Carnot of France, Tsar Alexander II of Russia, the Spanish prime minister, C�novas del Castillo, and, earlier this year, the empress Elisabeth of Austria-�Hungary. Perhaps the violence was now coming here to England as well?<br><br>In front of Pitt there was a body, or what was left of it. Suddenly he could not swallow, and he thought for a moment that he was going to be sick. One leg was entirely gone, one side of the chest caved in under part of a beam from the rafters. But the man&#x2019;s face was oddly unmarked. Pitt could recognize Newman.<br><br>He would have to go and see Newman&#x2019;s widow, say all the usual words of grief. It would not help, but its omission would hurt.<br><br>He stared at the body. Did it tell him anything, other than what the fireman had already said? There was no smoke on Newman&#x2019;s face. His left arm was mostly gone, but when Pitt looked more closely he saw his right hand was clean. Did that mean he was already inside here when the bomb went off? He had not battled his way through smoke and rubble. Why had he come here? Trouble reported? An alarm of some sort? Following someone? A meeting already arranged? An ambush?<br><br>He turned and moved away, dizzy for a moment. He took a deep breath, steadied himself, and pressed on.<br><br>The second body was half-�obscured by fallen plaster and wood, but it was far less obviously damaged. There was little smoke or dust on Hobbs&#x2019;s face and his pattern of freckles was easily recognizable. Pitt studied him as dispassionately as he could, trying to learn something from the way the debris lay around him. The police surgeon would be able to tell him more, but it appeared that Hobbs had been caught by surprise, and much further from the site of the explosion than Newman.<br><br>Pitt was still staring at the surroundings when he heard footsteps somewhere behind him. He turned and saw the familiar figure of Samuel Tellman picking his way through the plaster, water, and charred wood. Tellman had been Pitt&#x2019;s sergeant when they were both at Bow Street. It had taken them a long time to be comfortable with each other. Tellman had distrusted anyone with a background as humble as Pitt&#x2019;s but who spoke like a gentleman. To him it seemed that Pitt&#x2019;s accent was affected, as if Pitt thought himself superior. Pitt felt no reason to explain that his speech was the product of having been educated along with Sir Arthur Desmond&#x2019;s son at the country estate where his father had been gamekeeper. When his father had been transported to Australia for a crime he had not committed, Pitt&#x2019;s mother had remained as laundress, and Sir Arthur had seen the young Pitt as a companion to his son and a spur to excel him in class. The whole story was a wound that still ached on his father&#x2019;s behalf, and it wasn&#x2019;t something he wished to discuss with Tellman. But years of working together had taught them a mutual respect, and loyalty.<br><br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, sir.&#x201d; Tellman stopped beside him.<br><br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, Inspector,&#x201d; Pitt replied.<br><br>Tellman stared down at the body. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m your liaison with the police, sir.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt had expected someone to provide liaison, partly because he was Special Branch and not in the regular police, but mostly because the victims were the police&#x2019;s own men. The internal loyalty of the police force was not unlike that of soldiers in an army at war. An officer facing danger had to have an absolute trust in those who stood beside him, or at his back.<br><br>Pitt nodded. It would be good to work with Tellman again&#x2014;�but he wished it were on anything other than this.<br><br>&#x201c;Looks like they were right here when it went off,&#x201d; Pitt observed. &#x201c;Newman must have been closest to it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes. I saw. What kind of a bloody lunatic would do this?&#x201d; Tellman&#x2019;s voice was tight, as if he were controlling it with difficulty. &#x201c;I want freedom for all men, and food, and houses, and the right to come and go as I please. But what the hell good does something like this do? Which anarchists did this, anyway? Spanish? Italian? French? Russian? Why in God&#x2019;s name do all the bloody lunatics in Europe come and live in London?&#x201d; He turned to face Pitt. &#x201c;Why do we let them?&#x201d; His face was white, two spots of color in his lean cheeks, anger in his eyes. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you know who they are? Isn&#x2019;t that what Special Branch is supposed to be for, to prevent exactly this from happening?&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt hunched his shoulders and drove his hands deeper into his pockets. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t make the policy, Tellman. And yes, I know who a lot of them are. Mostly they just talk.&#x201d;<br><br>The disgust and the pain in Tellman&#x2019;s face were more powerful than words. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll find them and hang them&#x2014;�whatever you want to do about it.&#x201d; It was a challenge.<br><br>Pitt did not bother to answer. He understood the emotion behind the words. Right at this moment he felt much the same. He might feel differently when he learned who was responsible. Some of the men branded as anarchists had done no more than protest for decent pay, enough to feed their families. A few of them had been imprisoned, tortured, and even executed, simply for protesting against injustice. Driven far enough, he might have done the same.<br><br>&#x201c;Why were these men here?&#x201d; he asked Tellman. &#x201c;Five of them, at this quiet house right on the park? It can&#x2019;t have been an inquiry. You don&#x2019;t need five men for that. There&#x2019;s no one else dead or hurt, so the house must have been empty. What were they doing?&#x201d;<br><br>Tellman&#x2019;s expression tightened. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know yet, but I mean to find out. But if the investigation was to do with anarchists, they would have told Special Branch what was going on. So it must be something else.&#x201d;<br><br>Pitt did not take that totally for granted as Tellman seemed to, but it was not the time to argue. &#x201c;Anything known about this address?&#x201d; he asked instead.<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d; Tellman looked around him. &#x201c;What about the bomb? Bombs are your business. What was it made of? Where was it put? How did they let it off?&#x201d;</p><h2>Stories of Faith and Courage from Cops on the Street (Battlefields &amp; Blessings)</h2><p><p><i>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stories of Faith and Courage From Cops on the Street </i>is a groundbreaking devotional book that demonstrates the vital difference men and women of faith make in law enforcement.&nbsp; As this is a date-specific daily devotional, stories that relate to a specific date or event (9/11/2001, major weather catastrophes, "line of duty" deaths, etc.) are strategically placed on or near&nbsp; the date&nbsp; the event occurred.&nbsp; This <i>Battlefields and Blessings </i>devotional book serves two purposes:</p> <ul> <li>It offers a glimpse in to what it's really like&nbsp; to be in law enforcement while demonstrating the spiritual side of the law enforcement community</li> <li>It presents law enforcement in a positive light as a career path filled with men and women who care deeply for the communities they serve</li> </ul><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stories run the gamut from light-hearted (a rookie who passes out while helping deliver a baby) to not-for-the-faint-of-heart (a bank shooting and a fatal auto accident).&nbsp; They represent every phase of law enforcement work and demonstrate that something happened relating to the incidents that simply cannot be explained away.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some days you will weep as you identify with the authentic tragedy shared.

They survived the military's brutal winnowing to reach its top echelon. They became the Army's most influential generals in the crucible of Iraq. <br><br>Collectively, their lives tell the story of the Army over the last four decades and illuminate the path it must travel to protect the nation over the next century. Theirs is a story of successes and failures, of ambitions achieved and thwarted, of the responsibilities and perils of command. The careers of this elite quartet show how the most powerful military force in the world entered a major war unprepared, and how the Army, drawing on a reservoir of talent that few thought it possessed, saved itself from crushing defeat against a ruthless, low-tech foe. In <i>The Fourth Star</i>, you'll follow:<br><br>�Gen. John Abizaid, one of the Army's most brilliant minds. Fluent in Arabic, he forged an unconventional path in the military to make himself an expert on the Middle East, but this unique background made him skeptical of the war he found himself leading. <br><br>�Gen. George Casey Jr., the son of the highest-ranking general to be killed in the Vietnam War. Casey had grown up in the Army and won praise for his common touch and skill as a soldier. He was determined not to repeat the mistakes of Vietnam but would take much of the blame as Iraq collapsed around him. <br><br>�Gen. Peter Chiarelli, an emotional, take-charge leader who, more than any other senior officer, felt the sting of the Army's failures in Iraq. He drove his soldiers, the chain of command, and the U.S. government to rethink the occupation plans&#x2013;yet rarely achieved the results he sought.<br><br>�Gen. David Petraeus, a driven soldier-scholar. Determined to reach the Army's summit almost since the day he entered West Point, he sometimes alienated peers with his ambition and competitiveness. When he finally got his chance in Iraq, he&#x2013;more than anyone&#x2013;changed the Army's conception of what was possible. <br><br>Masterfully written and richly reported, <i>The Fourth Star</i> ranges far beyond today's battlefields, evoking the Army's tumultuous history since Vietnam through these four captivating lives and ultimately revealing a fascinating irony: In an institution that prizes obedience, the most effective warriors are often those who dare to question the prevailing orthodoxy and in doing so redefine the American way of war.</p><p>DAVID CLOUD was the Pentagon correspondent for the <i>New York Times</i> from 2005 to 2007. He previously worked at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, where he covered national security and intelligence issues. <br><br>GREG JAFFE is the Pentagon correspondent at the <i>Washington Post </i>and previously held the same position at the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>. In 1999, he was part of a team of reporters that won the Pulitzer Prize for national reporting.Chapter One: Age of Anarchy<br><br>Along the Cambodia&#x2013;South Vietnam border<br>June 29, 1970<br><br>The helicopters descended onto the hilltop clearing, wave after wave, a vast armada of American power. Out of them tumbled soldiers with rifles and rucksacks, returning from the invasion of Cambodia. They were mud-caked and sodden after three days of monsoon rain, but many were grinning and snapping pictures with their buddies. A few flashed peace signs for the television cameras, happy to have survived this madcap ordeal. The United States and its South Vietnamese allies had crossed into Cambodia precisely two months earlier on President Richard Nixon's orders, setting off the biggest protests of the war at home. Nixon had promised that every soldier would be out by the end of June, and they would be. The last of the rear guard would be flown back into Vietnam by six that evening.<br><br>Major General George Casey, commander of the 1st Air Cavalry Division, stood at the edge of the landing zone. The White House wanted the operation dressed up as a major victory, so Casey, sad-eyed and handsome, was there to brief reporters ferried out from Saigon for the day, along with a group of congressmen on a fact-finding mission. The facts were these: In eight weeks of combing through the Cambodian jungle, U.S. and South Vietnamese troops had captured vast stores of munitions, rice, and other supplies in so-called enemy sanctuaries that had long been off-limits. They had fought several battles and reported killing or capturing more than 10,000 Communist troops. But the invasion and the secret bombing that preceded it had destabilized Cambodia and achieved little that would help gain victory in Vietnam. The operation marked the beginning of the slow American pullout from Southeast Asia, a last push before the Army, bloodied and tired after five years of combat, began going home for good. Casey didn't exaggerate the gains. The enemy, he knew, would recover and the war would go on. But, he told the reporters, the operation had bought some time for their South Vietnamese allies, who soon would have to stand on their own. "I've done two tours over here," he yelled over the roar of the helicopter rotors, and going into Cambodia "was an opportunity we thought we'd never have."<br><br>He was a good soldier doing his duty, as he had for decades. After Pearl Harbor, Casey had withdrawn from Harvard University and enrolled at West Point, receiving his commission too late to see action in World War II. In Korea, he commanded an infantry company, earning a battlefield promotion to captain at Heartbreak Ridge, along with a Silver Star, the Army's third-highest honor. He went on to work as a personal aide to General Lyman Lemnitzer, a future chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and then returned to Harvard as a military fellow from 1965 to 1966. He spent most of the remainder of the decade commanding troops in Vietnam and seemed sure to ascend to four stars. Already he was being talked about as a future chief of the Army, as his West Point classmates had foreseen in 1945 when they predicted, "He will be the Army's best."<br><br>A week after the withdrawal from Cambodia, Casey climbed into the copilot seat of his Huey helicopter at 1st Air Cav headquarters and took off, flying east. He was headed for the U.S. base at Cam Ranh Bay to visit wounded soldiers. It was raining and visibility was so poor that his chief of staff, Colonel Edward "Shy" Meyer, had urged him to cancel the trip, but he wanted to see his men before they were transferred to hospitals in Japan. The helicopter's path took it across Vietnam's mountainous central highlands. At about 10:00 a.m. his Huey flew into a dense cloud and disappeared. A second helicopter flying behind crisscrossed over the shrouded peaks, looking for any sign of the general's craft, but finally had to break off when its fuel began running low. The American military headquarters in Saigon ordered a massive search. Not wanting to alert the Viet Cong that a high-ranking general was unaccounted for, it held off making a public announcement until a few days later.<br><br>On July 9, the New York Times put the story on the front page: "The United States Army disclosed today that Maj. Gen. George W. Casey, who directed the withdrawal of the last American ground troops from Cambodia on June 29, has been missing since Tuesday when he took off in his helicopter. An intensive search is under way, an Army spokesman said."<br><br>****<br><br>Casey's son, George junior, was sitting in the apartment that he and his new wife, Sheila, shared on Pennsylvania Avenue in Washington, D.C., near the Capitol when the phone rang. It was his mother. "Your father's helicopter crashed. He's missing," she told him. As they spoke George tried to sound optimistic, as painful as it was, but when he hung up and told Sheila the news, he was matter-of-fact. "Mom's hopeful," he said. "But you don't go down in one of those helicopters and survive."<br><br>He knew the Army. He had grown up with it and, even at age twenty-two, had its fatalism about death. Born in Japan on an Army base, he spent his childhood years moving every two years with his parents from one installation to another, an experience that had turned him into a jokester who made friends easily and applied himself as little as possible. He was, in that respect, completely different from his father. The Caseys were Boston Irish, and George junior had more than a little Irish mirth about him. It was the younger George who supplied the entertainment at the family's formal Sunday dinners. The table was set with linen napkins, china, and silver candlesticks. George and his brother, Peter, were expected to wear coats and ties. The three Casey girls, Joan, Ann, and Winn, and their mother wore dresses. Their father quizzed his brood about current events, which in an Army house in the mid-1960s usually meant the war or the protests that were just beginning in college towns such as Berkley and Cambridge. When their father brought up Vietnam, George would usually make a joke and shift the conversation. Once he came to dinner in a coat and tie but no shirt, causing his sisters to erupt in peals of laughter.<br><br>His younger sisters were far more emotional on the subject&#x2014;proud of their father, but also angry that the war pulled him away. George's teenage sister Joan responded to one of her father's Vietnam queries by declaring: "I'd go to Canada before I'd go to Vietnam!" A few months later she wrote a high-school essay on growing up as an Army brat and how their itinerant life, moving every two years and crisscrossing Europe in a beat-up station wagon, had drawn the family closer. When her father read it, she recalled, he began to cry.<br><br>Outwardly George, the eldest of the five Casey children, seemed the least bothered by the war. In the spring of 1966 he had applied to go to the United States Military Academy at West Point, mostly to please his father, but his math grades had been too low to get in. He enrolled instead at Georgetown University, just a few miles from his parents' brick colonial in Arlington, Virginia, across the Potomac River from the Georgetown campus. He signed up for the Army's Reserve Officer Training Corps program, played football, and always seemed to have the remnants of a six-pack stashed in his dorm room. George and his friends&#x2014;Irish kids from Boston, New York, and New Jersey&#x2014;crashed parties, hung out at the Tombs, a popular Georgetown bar, and squeaked by in class. At first they gave little thought to Vietnam. "We rooted for the Americans the way you'd root for the bobsled team at the Olympics," recalled Ray O'Hara, one of George's closest college friends.<br><br>George would always remember the Sunday afternoon in 1968 when he and O'Hara went downtown to check out the war protests by the White House. George threw on his Army jacket to ward off the chill. As he moved through the throngs of protesters he noticed that many in the crowd were wearing green field jackets identical to his. To them it was some sort of counterculture statement. Feeling uncomfortable, Casey took his coat off and tucked it under his arm. A few minutes later someone threw a garbage can at a police officer, and a melee erupted. George and his friend took off, unsure what they were doing at the protest in the first place.<br><br>The anger over the war was remaking the Georgetown campus. When George entered in 1966 male students still wore coats and ties to class and more than 900 of his classmates were enrolled in the university's ROTC program. By the fall of 1969, the coats and ties were gone and only sixty stalwarts were left in ROTC, including George. None of his friends had stayed in the program. "It was something I did by myself," he recalled. As he walked across campus one day in uniform, a group of protesters handing out antiwar pamphlets started to shout at him. One of his closest friends circled back and flipped over a table, sending the antiwar propaganda flying.<br><br>During his senior year, George worked at a bar, attended classes sporadically, and cruised around town on his motorcycle, which he had nicknamed Brutus. He scored mostly C's and D's, but figured his grades didn't matter. When he was done with college he'd almost certainly be off to Vietnam, where his father was already on his second tour. George promised Sheila, the tall, pretty girl from Immaculata College he had started dating his junior year, that he wasn't going to be a career soldier like his dad. After his required four-year hitch, he planned on attending law school.<br><br>In April 1970, his dad came home from Vietnam to see his family before taking command of the 1st Air Cav. His new assignment meant a promotion. On April 30, he pinned on the second star of a major general at a promotion ceremony at the Pentagon. That evening, the Caseys hosted a party at their house to celebrate. The guests were mostly other middle-aged officers and their wives, but George stopped by with a few of his college buddies. They stayed in the kitchen at first, drinking beers and watching the older guests through the doorway to the living room. An oil painting of West Point's granite chapel hung on the wall.<br><br>It was the same night that Nixon announced the invasion of Cambodia in a speech from the Oval Office, and when the address began, everyone clustered around the tiny television set. Only ten days earlier, Nixon had announced he was pulling an additional 150,000 troops out of Vietnam, on top of the 100,000 already due to come home. Now standing before a gigantic map of Southeast Asia, he declared that he was widening the war to attack staging areas in Cambodia used by the North Vietnamese to funnel supplies into the south. It was an angry, deceptive speech that portrayed the United States as violating Cambodian neutrality with great reluctance and only in a supporting role to South Vietnamese troops already flowing across the border. He didn't mention the secret bombing campaign that had already been under way for months. The speech, however, was about more than just Vietnam and Cambodia; Nixon tried in his maudlin way to address the dark mood that had taken over the country.<br><br>"My fellow Americans, we live in an age of anarchy, both abroad and at home," he began. "We see mindless attacks on all the great institutions which have been created by free civilizations in the last 500 years. Even here in the United States, great universities are being systematically destroyed. Small nations all over the world find themselves under attack from within and from without. If when the chips are down the world's most powerful nation, the United States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions throughout the world."<br><br>The president's words drew a cheer from the military men around the television set who believed they were finally striking back at the enemy's supply lines across the border in Cambodia. Nixon didn't say so, but everyone at the Casey house knew it was the 1st Air Cav, the Army division that George Casey Sr. would take command of when he returned to the war, that was spearheading the attack into the "Parrot's Beak," an area along the South Vietnam&#x2013;Cambodia border only thirty-three miles from Saigon. Nixon's gambit might have pleased the military men, but George's college friends were disgusted. He was expanding the war that they all hated only weeks after announcing a drawdown of troops. George's friends began to argue with the elder Casey, insisting that Vietnam was lost and the invasion would only lead to more deaths. The Caseys' teenage daughter Winn, who was sitting at her father's feet as the argument grew louder and more emotional, ran to her room and slammed the door. After a few minutes, her father walked upstairs to check on her.<br><br>"How could those people talk to you like that?" she sobbed.<br><br>"Those boys stand to lose their lives if they go to Vietnam," he replied. "They are entitled to their opinions."<br><br>George had become expert at navigating the middle ground between his Georgetown friends and his family. He generally supported the war, but he wasn't the kind of person to get in arguments or begrudge his friends their opinions. Neither was his dad. One of the reasons the younger Casey had invited his friends to the promotion party was that he wanted them to meet a soldier who believed in the war yet did not consider opposition to it an act of treason. He also wanted his father, who had spent most of the last three years at war, to meet his friends.<br><br>In the days after the speech college campuses around the country exploded. ROTC buildings were attacked or burned. At Kent State University, a unit of Ohio National Guard soldiers opened fire on a crowd of students, killing four of them. At Georgetown, like most colleges, there were protests and violence, and the school responded by canceling final exams. Amid this tumult George's family said goodbye to his father, who was heading back to Vietnam. On a warm spring day George, his mother, and his father climbed into the family's Mustang convertible for the hour drive to the airport. In the car with the top down and the wind whipping their hair, George broke the news that he had asked Sheila to marry him. Mrs. Casey and George's two youngest sisters were going to move to the Philippines later that summer to be closer to his father. So they were planning on having the wedding in mid-June, before his family left for Asia.<br><br>George and his mother walked his dad to the gate at Baltimore- Washington International Airport, hugged him one last time, and then watched as he disappeared down the carpeted ramp to his plane. "You've done this so much that it must get easier," George said, turning to his mom. His mother, who had always remained stoic for her children when their father was heading out to war, for once didn't bother to disguise her anguish. "No," she replied. "It just gets harder."<br><br>****<br><br>A little more than two months after the elder Casey returned to Vietnam his family got the news that his helicopter was missing. On July 11, arriving for the lunch shift at the Capitol Hill saloon where he was tending bar that summer, George noticed his father's picture on the front page of the Washington Post. He didn't need to read the story. They had found the wreckage and his father was dead.<br><br>George met the casket at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware and escorted it to Washington. On July 23, 1970, his father was buried with full military honors. The day began with a funeral mass at Holy Trinity Church in Georgetown. The elder Casey was one of the highest-ranking soldiers to die in Vietnam, and much of official Washington was there.

In his book, Gioia more fully addressed the question: Is there a place for poetry to be part of modern American mainstream culture? Ten years later, the debate is as lively and heated as ever. Graywolf is pleased to re-issue this highly acclaimed collection in a handsome new edition, which includes a new Introduction by distinguished critic and poet, Dana Gioia.</p></p><p>When Dana Gioia&#39;s essay &#34;Can Poetry Matter?&#34; appeared in the Atlantic in 1991, it sparked a firestorm of debate and discussion over the role of the poet in today&#39;s world - a dialogue in which Gioia participated on radio, television, and in print. One of the more stimulating and provocative figures on our literary horizon, and the author of two widely praised books of poems, Gioia is also an essayist of wide renown. This collection of essays demonstrates that Gioia&#39;s talents do not lie in the area of controversy alone. Can Poetry Matter? is an old-fashioned sort of literary book, part literary criticism, part social commentary, and part plain good reading. Addressing such subjects as the poet as businessman and New Formalism as the real avant-garde, it also includes pieces on the life and work of such diverse figures as Robinson Jeffers, Weldon Kees, Robert Bly, and Wallace Stevens. In an age when literary discourse often seems either bleached of any real content or academic to the point of inaccessibility, the essays in Can Poetry Matter? are certain to educate, provoke, and, perhaps most of all, delight readers. They also establish Dana Gioia as one of the foremost cultural observers of his generation.<p>An acclaimed poet, essayist, anthologist, BBC commentator, and critic, <b>Dana Gioia</b> is also the author of, most recently, <i>Interrogations at Noon</i>, a collection of poems that received the American Book Award, and <i>Nosferatu</i>, a libretto. He was recently nominated to be Chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts and lives in Santa Rosa, California, with his family.</p></p><h2>The Hidden Child</h2><p>Worldwide bestseller Camilla Lackberg weaves together another brilliant contemporary psychological thriller with the chilling struggle of a young woman facing the darkest chapter of Europe&#39;s past!

He was among her mother&#39;s circle of friends during the Second World War but her questions are met with bizarre and evasive answers. Two days later he meets a violent death. Detective Patrik Hedstrom, Erica&#39;s husband, is on paternity leave but soon becomes embroiled in the murder investigation. Who would kill so ruthlessly to bury secrets so old? Reluctantly Erica must read her mother&#39;s wartime diaries. But within the pages is a painful revelation about Erica&#39;s past. Could what little knowledge she has be enough to endanger her husband and newborn baby? The dark past is coming to light, and no one will escape the truth of how they came to be!</p><p>Camilla Lackberg is a worldwide bestseller renowned for her brilliant contemporary psychological thrillers. Her novels have sold over 20 million copies in 55 countries with translations into 37 languages.Long troubled by her late mother&#x2019;s coldness toward her two daughters, writer Erica Falck begins to read her mother, Elsy&#x2019;s, teenage diaries. She also discovers a Nazi war medal with the diaries and asks a retired history teacher to examine it. Within days, the teacher is bludgeoned to death. Then Britta, Elsy&#x2019;s closest friend as a teenager, who is suffering from Alzheimer&#x2019;s, is also murdered. Through the diaries, Erica intuits that the solution to the mystery is rooted in events that took place during WWII. Once again, L�ckberg (The Stonecutter, 2012) employs Swedish history and her setting, Fjallbacka, the postcard-pretty village where Falck grew up, to craft an engaging tale that spans three generations of Fjallbackians. The author goes deep into the lives of a very large cast of characters, and some crime lovers might balk at a 520-plus&#x2013;page novel that is almost half family saga. But taken as a whole, The Hidden Child will keep fans of Swedish crime guessing until the final pages. --Thomas Gaughan</p><h2>The Line of Departure: A Postapocalyptic Novel (The New World Series)</h2><p><b>A gripping new novel from one of the best-known names in survivalist fiction.</b><br><br>Former Marine-turned-author, G.

Yes, the author sits behind the glow of the screen tapping away for what seems like endless hours creating the characters, plot, and story that will eventually become the book. But once that first draft is complete, an author, if he&#x2019;s doing it correctly, will send it off to a trusted confidante and, in many ways, collaborator: the editor. I have had the honor and great fortune to be surrounded by an incredible editorial team at Plume. I don&#x2019;t know all of their individual names, but the one person who has worked with me to ensure that my novels have been readable, richer, and top-notch has been Kate Napolitano, editor at Plume. Her careful eye and attention to detail has aided me in making <i>The Line of Departure</i> the great book it is. She worked closely with me, pushing and encouraging me as I went through the most extensive rewrite I&#x2019;ve ever done in my life. It was her insistence and vision that the book could be better that led to the book you&#x2019;re about to read. When I turned it in originally, it was a totally different book. I want to thank her from the bottom of my heart for being open, honest, and professional, as an editor should be. </p><p>I am often asked for advice by aspiring writers. Besides my typical response of &#x201c;Just write,&#x201d; I now follow up by saying, &#x201c;Get an editor&#x2014;they&#x2019;re a priceless asset to your team.&#x201d;</p><p>Thank you, Kate, and thank you, editorial staff at Plume.</p><p></p><p></p><p>PROLOGUE</p><p>OCTOBER 19, 2066</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>McCall, Idaho, Republic of Cascadia</p><p>Hunter Rutledge exited the warmth of the aircraft only to be greeted by a brisk wind. He lifted the collar on his thick wool peacoat and headed toward the lobby of the small airport. He took a deep breath and tried to prepare himself for the unknown. McCall had played a large part in his family&#x2019;s history, but this was the first time he had stepped foot here. There was nothing like the promise that something &#x201c;life changing&#x201d; had happened to encourage him to seek out his roots, and that&#x2019;s exactly what had been promised to him by his brother, Sebastian. Even after badgering him for more information about what possibly could be in McCall that needed his immediate attention, Sebastian stood firm and said it would be better for Hunter to come see himself. How could anyone turn down an invite promising something so profound? Curiosity got the best of him, and so he soon found himself on a small plane, unsure of what to expect.</p><p>As he strode toward the terminal building, the first thing that struck him was how small a place it was. It surprised him, especially considering what he had seen on his flight. As his plane made its approach, he had peered out the window like a small child, eager for the view. He marveled at the size of Long Valley, how it stretched north for miles on end. An early dusting of snow capped the exposed granite tops of the two mountain ranges on either side; the white transitioning to the deep green of the pines, then segueing into the patchwork of browns, tans, and greens of the valley floor. He took in every mountain, road, and building he could until they landed just south of town.</p><p>Hunter was the deputy chief of mission for the embassy, a busy man whose schedule was dictated by political turmoil&#x2014;and in this day and age, there seemed to be a nonstop supply. If he didn&#x2019;t have such a great relationship with the ambassador, he wouldn&#x2019;t have been able to make the trip to McCall. His original itinerary took him back to Austin, Texas, today, but when he asked for some leave due to personal family issues, the ambassador granted it without discussion. Hunter was a consummate professional, never one to take a day off, so for him to ask for leave meant that it was something serious. It was just too bad that he didn&#x2019;t know what this serious thing could be.</p><p>Just a few feet shy of the entrance he stopped and took in his surroundings. &#x201c;So this is the fabled McCall,&#x201d; he said to himself.</p><p>A large man wearing an orange vest opened the door and said cheerfully, &#x201c;Welcome to McCall! What brings you here?&#x201d;</p><p>Hunter looked around the sparse lobby of the terminal. Small red leather-bound chairs lined the walls, interrupted every few feet by tiny tables covered with magazines and newspapers. In the corner of the room was a counter with old computer monitors and behind it a board listed arrivals and departures. He took notice that the board only listed one other arrival coming in later in the day, and the only departing flight was for tomorrow morning.</p><p>Realizing that he hadn&#x2019;t promptly answered the man&#x2019;s question, he said, &#x201c;Sorry, I was expecting to meet someone here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No one here but us,&#x201d; the man said, shrugging his shoulders.</p><p>Hunter shook his head, exasperated. Sebastian told him he&#x2019;d be there upon his arrival, but being typical Sebastian, he was late.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Hunter looked at his watch and grimaced. Sebastian was now two hours late. He couldn&#x2019;t wait any longer, not when he was this anxious. After asking for directions, he departed the terminal and headed toward town. He chuckled to himself when he saw the street sign for Van Zandt Boulevard. His own family namesake, emblazoned for all to see.</p><p>As he walked, the occasional truck or car drove past, but as a whole, the town seemed sleepy and quiet. Large ponderosa pine trees towered over the houses and small commercial spaces that fronted the street. He had heard so many stories about McCall over the years&#x2014;it had given his mother a place to call home as a child and was the birthplace of their republic. It was hard for him now to see how this tiny mountain town could have been so instrumental in the beginnings of a new country. The town had a population of less than seven thousand people, but those people had the vision and drive to be independent from the tyrannical forces that collided during the Great Civil War. McCall may not have started as a unique place, but it became pivotal because of one person: his grandfather, Gordon Van Zandt.</p><p>Hunter inhaled deeply through his nose. The fresh smell of the alpine air invigorated him. He strode closer to the lake, taking mental notes on restaurants and bars he saw along the way. He wasn&#x2019;t sure how long he&#x2019;d be in town, and knowing where to eat and, more specifically, where to grab a drink was a priority.</p><p>The blare of a truck&#x2019;s horn startled him and brought him to the present. He turned in the direction of the sound and saw an old Ford coming his way. Its side panels were decayed from rust, its blue paint faded to the point that primer now showed. The years of being subjected to the harsh conditions of the mountains had taken its toll on the truck, clearly.</p><p>&#x201c;Bro, I&#x2019;m so sorry. I&#x2019;m such an ass. I was tied up!&#x201d; Sebastian hollered out from the cab.</p><p>Hunter peered at his baby brother&#x2019;s beard-covered face. &#x201c;You <i>are</i> an ass. And a late one at that.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian leaned over and unlocked the passenger-side door. Hunter tossed his duffel into the bed and got in. &#x201c;So. I&#x2019;m here. What the hell is up?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Nice to see you too,&#x201d; Sebastian joked, making a U-turn in the road and heading south out of town.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m starving. If you&#x2019;re not going to tell me what&#x2019;s up, can we at least stop and get something to eat?&#x201d; Hunter said.</p><p>&#x201c;No time! Where we&#x2019;re going there&#x2019;s plenty of food,&#x201d; Sebastian said happily.</p><p>Hunter rolled his eyes. As much as he loved his brother, they were very different people. Sebastian took after his grandfather in his demeanor and thirst for adventure. He loved life and wanted nothing more than to see the world. As soon as he was of age he had left home and never looked back. Now in his mid-twenties, he had finally taken interest in his roots, and this desire for knowledge had taken him to McCall. Hunter was the polar opposite&#x2014;steadfast, reliable, and grounded. He knew every detail about the Van Zandt and Rutledge families. It was a priority for him to maintain the reputation the name gave him. He was proud of his family&#x2019;s history, regardless of current revisionism taking place in the media.</p><p>&#x201c;So, where the hell have you been?&#x201d; Hunter asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Everywhere!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I just saw Mom and she&#x2019;s worried about you. You need to call her,&#x201d; Hunter chided.</p><p>Sebastian cut him a look and answered, &#x201c;I love Mom, but&#x201d;&#x2014;he paused, clearly trying to figure out how to present the information&#x2014;&#x201c;it&#x2019;s just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. she hasn&#x2019;t been honest with us. That&#x2019;s part of the reason why I asked you to come here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What are you talking about?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What she told us about Grandma and Granddad were not true. To be blunt, I now question everything she ever told us.&#x201d;</p><p>Hunter pursed his lips. &#x201c;Mom&#x2019;s been through a lot. I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;re talking about, but right now she&#x2019;s being interviewed by the paper about the family, about everything.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really? I wonder if she&#x2019;ll tell the truth.&#x201d;</p><p>Sebastian took a left off the highway and headed east. The one-lane county road was paved but the lack of maintenance made for a bumpy ride. The towering ponderosa pines were now gone, replaced by the tall grasses and small shrubbery of the open valley.</p><p>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;re not telling me what we&#x2019;re doing, can you at least tell me where we&#x2019;re going?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Almost there, calm down! You&#x2019;re going to love it here. McCall is a great place&#x2014;I can&#x2019;t believe it&#x2019;s taken me so long to get here. I&#x2019;ve learned so much about the family since I&#x2019;ve been here.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Since when have you given two hoots about the family?&#x201d; Hunter asked, an edge in his tone.</p><p>&#x201c;I know I&#x2019;ve not been the best brother or son, but when I was in New Zealand a few months back, I had a chance encounter with this woman&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;How surprising,&#x201d; Hunter interjected. Sebastian had a reputation for being a playboy.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like that. She was an older woman, and she knew the family. She had known Granddad, Hunter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I knew that would pique your interest.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I hope it&#x2019;s not another person claiming how bad he was. I&#x2019;m sick of hearing that side of the story.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve heard the stories. But what if I was to tell you there&#x2019;s a different perspective?&#x201d; Sebastian said as the truck slowed and pulled into a gravel driveway.</p><p>Sebastian stopped the truck in front of a metal gate and got out to unlock it, hollering at Hunter to drive the truck in. Once the gate was secure again, Sebastian jumped into the passenger side and instructed him to drive.</p><p>Hunter paused. He trusted his brother but the entire situation made him uneasy. He peered down the long drive; mature groves of aspen trees to either side gave it an ominous look.</p><p>&#x201c;C&#x2019;mon, let&#x2019;s go. You&#x2019;re hungry and I got to use the bathroom,&#x201d; Sebastian urged.</p><p>Hunter put the truck in gear and drove down the driveway. After a quarter mile, the green metal roof of a house came in view. His curiosity was at a high. He leaned in and stared as more and more of the house came into view. It looked very familiar.</p><p>&#x201c;Is this Mom&#x2019;s old house?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yep.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I thought Mom said this was gone, that they had sold it.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s the first lie,&#x201d; Sebastian blurted out.</p><p>Sebastian&#x2019;s excitement for what Hunter was about to see couldn&#x2019;t be contained. &#x201c;C&#x2019;mon!&#x201d; he yelled, and jogged to a side door next to the garage. He pulled out a key and unlocked the door. When the final click of the last tumbler fell on the lock, a bark from a large dog sounded out.</p><p>Sebastian grabbed the handle and opened the door slowly so as not to let the dog, a pit bull, out. &#x201c;Oh, who&#x2019;s a good boy?&#x201d; Sebastian said to the dog. The dog wiggled with excitement and licked Sebastian&#x2019;s hand intensely. The dog&#x2019;s friendly behavior was the antithesis of its appearance.</p><p>&#x201c;This is Irish,&#x201d; Sebastian told Hunter.</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Irish,&#x201d; Hunter said, just standing behind his brother. He wasn&#x2019;t much of a dog lover and didn&#x2019;t have too much experience with them, as their mother, Haley, never allowed them when they grew up.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Sebastian!&#x201d; Sebastian called out.</p><p>They entered a small mudroom. The only furniture in the small space was a bench, coatrack, and baskets with boots and shoes. Irish bolted ahead of them into the main part of the house. Both men took off their shoes and followed him. The next room they walked into was a large kitchen. The appliances in it were at least fifty years old, but what stuck out was how clean everything was. Whoever lived there took great care to keep it that way. The kitchen opened up to a large great room with twenty-five-foot ceilings. A large rock fireplace and chimney spanned the distance from the ground to the wood-beamed ceiling. From this room, one could sit on the large sectional sofa and overlook the valley and a creek that was a hundred yards off the back of the house. Jug Handle Mountain stood prominently in the distance.</p><p>Hunter was captivated by the view and approached the windows to get a better look. It was stunningly beautiful. He was starting to understand what his grandparents saw in this part of Idaho. His awe was shattered when the realities of the years before came crashing down. Off in the distance, under a large pine tree, sat a gated graveyard. The site of graveyards in this age was common. After the lights went out, the luxury of having funeral homes and municipal graveyards disappeared. If someone died in your family they&#x2019;d have to prepare the body and bury it themselves. But knowing what those graves meant&#x2014;the history behind them&#x2014;took Hunter&#x2019;s breath away.</p><p>&#x201c;Mom said this was a cabin, not a compound,&#x201d; Hunter remarked.</p><p>&#x201c;I know.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;This house is huge. What do you think, three-thousand-plus square feet?&#x201d; Hunter asked out loud.</p><p>&#x201c;More like four thousand,&#x201d; a voice echoed from the hall beyond.</p><p>Hunter turned around quickly. The hallway was dark, but in the shadows a person moved slowly toward them.</p><p>Hunter&#x2019;s heart pounded with anticipation as an elderly man with a cane appeared. The man walked up to Hunter and outstretched his hand.</p><p>Hunter was confused; there was something about his weathered face that seemed so familiar. When his eyes fell on a scar on the man&#x2019;s right cheek, his stomach dropped. <i>It can&#x2019;t be, </i>he thought to himself. He was dead. His mother had told him he had died years before. History books had talked about his demise. There had been a state funeral. His mother told him about how sad the republic had been when one of its founding fathers had passed. So many questions came rushing at him; he was overwhelmed with confusion.</p><p>&#x201c;Granddad?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Hi, Hunter.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Granddad, it can&#x2019;t be you. You&#x2019;re supposed to be dead!&#x201d; Hunter exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t always believe what you read,&#x201d; Gordon said.</p><p>Hunter was in shock, but he extended his hand to his grandfather&#x2019;s and shook it. Gordon gripped it tightly.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go sit in my office,&#x201d; Gordon recommended. He led them down the hallway to a set of large double doors that opened to a dimly lit space. The smell of cigar smoke wafted over Hunter. In the room were two large leather chairs with matching leather ottomans. Both were positioned in front of ano...</p></p><h2>Curious George Big Book of Adventures (CGTV)</h2><p>Young readers&nbsp;will find that&nbsp;learning is always an adventure with&nbsp;Curious George!&nbsp;Now you can get twelve&nbsp;exciting&nbsp;books based on the Emmy Award&#x2013;winning PBS&nbsp;TV series&#x2014;all packed into in one big bargain of a&nbsp;book .

As the girls investigate a potential connection to Olivia's birth parents, someone sets fire to the school, and Emily's stepmother goes missing. The young teens try to solve all of these mysteries at once, but run afoul of their parents. While the plot is fast-paced and the overall mood suspenseful and engaging, the dialogue is clumsy and the narrative can feel pedantic. Set in a small town in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, Cobble charmingly captures an interwoven community with festivals, school spirit, and overlapping relationships. Fans returning to the series will enjoy the welcome trip with familiar faces, but new readers might be confused at the lack of backstory for the many characters. The personal growth of Emily and Olivia is told rather than shown through their actions, which causes the characters to feel static. Though not outstanding, this is a solid choice for libraries who own the first title, Search &amp; Rescue (Thomas Nelson, 2013), Cobble's adult series set in the same town, or in communities where Christian fiction is in high demand.&#x2014;Elizabeth Nicolai, Anchorage Public Library, AK</p><h2>Our Nig: or, Sketches from the Life of a Free Black</h2><p><b>With a New Introduction and Notes by Henry Louis Gates, Jr. and Richard J.

J. Ellis<br><br>I can say with much pleasure that when the Regenerator was first applied to my own hair it was very gray, and falling from my head, and my scalp was in a very unhealthy state; but upon a few applications I discovered a decided change, and soon my hair assumed its original color and health of youth.<br><br>-Mrs. H. E. Wilson, Nashua, N.H.<br><br>Harriet E. Adams Wilson's Our Nig (1859) is the first novel written and published in English by an African American woman writer. The story Wilson tells is profoundly moving and seemingly straightforward. But this straightforwardness is deceptive: the novel, taking as its unusual focus the fate of a Northern mulatta, Alfrado (or Frado) Smith, explores in unique detail the contested position of free blacks in antebellum America, and specifically the plight of female free blacks, at what was a highly problematic time in America's racial history.<br><br>Frado is deserted as a young girl by Mag Smith, her white mother, following the death of her African American father, Jim, "a kind- hearted African," and Mag's subsequent marriage to Jim's friend, Seth Shipley. The Shipleys cannot cope financially and decide to move away, resolving to leave Frado behind. They deposit Frado at the home of a white New England farming family, the Bellmonts. There she becomes their farm servant, treated harshly and derogatorily nicknamed "Our Nig." Two members of this family, Mrs. Bellmont and her daughter, Mary, sadistically mistreat Frado. The males of the Bellmont household and a maiden aunt, Aunt Abby, voice their support for her and sometimes even attempt to protect her but fail to assist her in any meaningful way, for lack of will and courage.<br><br>The novel depicts Frado's progress in learning to defend herself from this harsh treatment by fighting back with words and actions and finding her voice. After years of mistreatment, Frado completes her period of service and is allowed to leave. Wilson sketchily outlines Frado's subsequent fortunes in two closing chapters, in which she meets a young black man, Samuel, quickly marries him, and has a child. He soon deserts her, after confessing to her that he is passing himself off as a fugitive slave in order to profit from the abolitionist lecture circuit. Left behind in New England, Frado does obtain some financial support, including public charity, but always lives in dire poverty. This destitution and her declining health (precipitated by Mrs. Bellmont's sustained physical abuse) eventually force her to leave her child in foster care as she struggles to survive.<br><br>Alongside Frado's story, we learn details of the Bellmont family's own problems, generated most often by Mrs. B.'s meanness. But the novel's plot focuses principally on Frado's sufferings and her uncertain progress toward embracing Christianity. Three pseudonymous testimonials at the end of the book emphasize the Christian context of the tale and urge its authenticity, while an author's preface explains that she is publishing her story to rescue herself and her child from destitution. One of the testimonials further reveals that the author and her child have been reduced to drawing upon public relief. Published in 1859, Our Nig offers, through this simple story, a very rare thing indeed: a sustained representation of the life of an antebellum free black female, born and bred in New England and working as a farm servant. As Alice Walker observed in 1983 in a comment published on the dust jacket of the first Random House edition edited by Henry Louis Gates, Jr., the novel is of "enormous significance" because it represents "heretofore unexamined experience." It is one of the very first full-length books written by an African American who was not a slave; it stands as a hallmark of literary history as the first novel published by an African American woman in the United States; and it subtly combines compelling storytelling with unflinching indictments of Northern anti-black racism.<br><br>Harriet Wilson seems to have published Our Nig herself (though likely with some assistance from unknown patrons), which makes its composition highly unusual: very few African American writers at this time could have taken such a step, an extraordinary one for an impoverished person of any race. The book's survival was to prove precarious for more than a hundred years, since, after one apparently very limited print run, it remained almost unnoticed until 1983, when Henry Louis Gates, Jr., established the identity and race of its author, recovered its history, and published the first new edition since 1859. His research revealed definitively that the book was a novel written by an African American female, thereby attracting for the first time concerted attention to Harriet E. Adams Wilson, her text, its place in literary history, and what it contributes to our understanding of the history of racism in antebellum America.<br><br>This definitive new edition, a century and a half after Harriet Wilson published the first edition, carefully lays out the ways in which the author's life helps illuminate the themes and concerns of her novel. In particular, for the first time, we examine in detail Wilson's extensive commitment to and engagement with the profession of spiritualism as she struggled to make a living for herself after she published her novel. We then bring these biographical matters to bear on the composition of Our Nig. By tracing in considerable detail just how difficult it was for her to carve out a place within Boston's spiritualist circles following the Civil War, we have established the extent of Harriet Wilson's astonishing achievements over the course of her unusual life.<br><br>Opening one of the few extant copies of the 1859 edition of Our Nig is a profoundly moving experience. The book was well produced, albeit with an unprepossessing board binding. Its spine contains the simplest information: the bald, disconcerting title Our Nig (accompanied by a colophon), but inside the title page adds a long and complex subtitle, followed by the obviously pseudonymous author's name. Nothing published before 1859 by any other black author could possibly prepare the reader for the unusual wording:<br><br>OUR NIG;<br><br>OR,<br><br>Sketches from the Life of a Free Black,<br><br>IN A TWO-STORY WHITE HOUSE, NORTH.<br><br>SHOWING THAT SLAVERY'S SHADOWS FALL EVEN THERE.<br><br>BY "OUR NIG."<br><br>The wording "Sketches from the Life . . . by 'Our Nig'_" of course reminds us of the subtitles of other narratives by African Americans, such as Frederick Douglass's 1845 slave narrative, which carries a subtitle informing us it was "Written by Himself," or Harriet Jacobs's Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, Written by Herself, published just two years after Harriet Wilson's novel appeared. But Our Nig's subtitle also establishes that it is written not by a slave, but by a "Free Black" living in the North. The title page as well as the novel itself undermine all expectations that anything like a conventional slave narrative is on offer. Wilson does not usher in a story about a daring dash to freedom from the South to the North, along a road paved by literacy, as Frederick Douglass famously asserted. Instead Frado remains trapped by the hardships imposed by widespread Northern racism. In the preface the author tells us she is "forced" to write her book as an "experiment which shall aid me in supporting myself and my child" (3). What lies before us indeed turns out to be an experiment; a unified fiction informed by the genres of the sentimental novel, the gothic autobiography, the slave narrative, and realism.<br><br>Our Nig's subtitle, by announcing that it is written by a "Free Black," in itself at once establishes the book as unusual, for very few texts had been published before this time by black authors who had not formerly been slaves. Appearing in 1859, Our Nig is predated by only a few works of fiction by black writers, including: Frederick Douglass's novella The Heroic Slave (1853); William Wells Brown's novel Clotel (1853); Frank Webb's The Garies and Their Friends (1857), and Martin R. Delany's Blake; or, The Huts of America (the first part serialized in The Anglo-African Magazine in 1859 and the remainder in the Weekly Anglo-African newspaper between 1861 and 1862). Whereas the theme of most of these works of fiction was slavery, Frank Webb depicted the lives of free African Americans in the North, just as Wilson would two years later. (Curiously enough, another black woman writer, Maria F. dos Reis, published a novel entitled Ursula in Brazil, also in 1859.)<br><br>Our Nig's subtitle further surprises when it notes that, though slavery had been abolished in the North, nevertheless "Slavery's Shadows Fall Even There." Very few writers before Wilson had chosen to focus on the way that slavery could blight the lives of free African Americans in the North. The "shadows" of slavery to which Wilson refers consist, on the one hand, of anti-black racism, of which Wilson's novel is a surprisingly bold and unflinching critique. But the subtitle also refers to the shadows cast on all black people's lives by the Fugitive Slave Act. Passed in 1850 at the behest of Southern slaveholders, the act facilitated the recapture of runaway slaves in the North, although slavery had already been abolished there, state by state. The law controversially compelled Northerners, including abolitionists and free blacks, to stand by impotently as African Americans were seized by slave catchers and returned to their "owners" in the South. The act made it illegal to intervene or offer any assistance to a fugitive. It also provided Northern magistrates with a financial incentive to accept that African Americans brought before them by slave catchers were indeed escaped slaves, thus encouraging the capricious seizure of free African Americans. Such kidnappings were not rare. Slavery's long shadows thus fell on all African Americans in the North, including Frado, Harriet Wilson's protagonist. At one point near her book's end she reports that Frado is "watched by kidnappers" and adds that "traps" were "slyly laid by the vicious to ensnare her" (129). Described in the novel as "beautiful" (17), Frado would have been highly desirable prey for lascivious slave owners, since female mixed-race slaves generally commanded the highest prices in Southern slave auctions.<br><br>More important than the risk of kidnap under the Fugitive Slave Act, "slavery's shadows" also alludes to the prevalence of racism in the Northern free states, such as New Hampshire. Especially during the three decades leading up to the Civil War, Southerners, forced on the defensive by abolitionists, sought to legitimate slavery's continuation through a racist argument proposing that African Americans' color, cranium shape, facial features, and hair texture proved that they were not fully human, or instead were a different or distinct species from human beings of European descent, represented as God's chosen creation. Proslavery propaganda represented people of African descent as vastly less intelligent than white people, more prone to laziness and violence, and more likely to surrender to base impulses and appetites, especially sexual ones. The seeds of "scientific" racism sown in this way (the science was, of course, pseudo-scientific, based on prejudice and superstition, entirely unfounded in reason or fact, and drawn up to justify a profoundly exploitative economic relationship) ensured that slavery's shadows would indeed fall across the whole of the United States long after its abolition and well into the twentieth century. Even those who opposed slavery were sometimes swayed, shockingly enough, by arguments for the innate inferiority of persons of African descent. (Harriet Beecher Stowe's depiction of Miss Ophelia's reluctance to touch Topsy in Uncle Tom's Cabin provides one famous example among countless others.)<br><br>By the time Our Nig was published, just two years before the Civil War began, the abolition movement had been gaining momentum throughout the North for several decades and had spread to popular culture. For example, the Hutchinson Family Singers, a New Hampshire troupe closely connected to Wilson's birthplace, Milford, toured throughout New England winning widespread acclaim for the songs they performed, portraying their state as freedom loving and opposed to slavery. Yet, even as the antislavery cause grew, America's leading white abolitionist, William Lloyd Garrison, was forced to expend time and energy trying to excise individual racism from among his followers. The New Hampshire abolitionist Nathaniel Rogers even came to believe that "laws could never eradicate prejudice and racial domination" and that a more fundamental, more perfect revolution than America's War of Independence was needed. What Rogers had seen in Canaan, New Hampshire, in 1835, where an attempt to desegregate Noyes Academy was greeted with violent resistance by the local community, no doubt informed his opinion about the deep-rooted nature of racial prejudice in American society and what it might take to eradicate it, both on an institutional and a behavioral level.<br><br>Our Nig therefore has good reason to allude to racism as "slavery's shadows" in the North, but it also establishes the novel's central theme: exposing the many ways in which Frado experiences anti-black racism at the hands of Northern whites and the ways in which race and class were inextricably intertwined in antebellum America, North and South. Our Nig takes up this theme in an unusual way, since its accent falls on abuse by white females (adapting Frederick Douglass's dramatic observation in his 1845 slave narrative that slavery turned many female slave owners into racists and sadists, even those initially reared in the North). Among the Bellmonts, during Frado's period of indenture, two of its females, Mary and Mrs. Bellmont, are depicted as the physically cruel ones. After she leaves them, another Northern white woman, Mrs. Hoggs, ignoring how feeble Frado has become after her years of mistreatment, reports her as a malingerer to the town's authorities. Yet, though some of the other Bellmonts have abolitionist sympathies, they do nothing to put an end to Frado's sufferings, which continue until she leaves their house. However much James Bellmont tells her that his "mother's views were by no means general" and assures her that she is not "friendless, and utterly despised" but instead "might hope for better things in the future" (76), he does nothing to intervene, and soon she is once again being "whipped with a rawhide" (77). James's brother, Jack, provides more sympathy, but no protection either.<br><br>Indeed, the lack of effective counters to racism in the "free" North is another key theme of the book. In chapter 1, the narrator ruminates ironically on the supposedly "degraded" condition of Mag Smith, Frado's white mother, because of her decision to marry an African American: "You can philosophize, gentle reader, upon the impropriety of such unions, and preach dozens of sermons on the evils of amalgamation. . . . Poor Mag. She had sundered another bond which held her to her fellows. She had descended another step down the ladder of infamy" (13). Mag Smith's decision to marry a black man leads her inexorably toward a state of social death in white society, precisely because of widespread Northern prejudices against what was then, objectionably, called "amalgamation." Nevertheless, Wilson refrains from representing Frado's parents' liaison sentimentally. Instead, she reveals that the motivations for this marriage are, at best, deeply fraught and problematic, especially those of Frado's father, Jim, whose unrelenting desire to have a white lover she represents as perverse. Even if Jim's motivations are dubious...</p><h2>Master Dogen&#39;s Shobogenzo, Book 2</h2><p>This translation, supported by the Japan Foundation, makes a strong claim to be the definitive translation of the 95 chapter edition of Shobogenzo, the essential Japanese Buddhist text, written in the 13th century by Zen Master Dogen. Following on from Shobogenzo Book 1, the second book in this four volume set contains chapters 22 to 41 from the 95-chapter edition, including these well-known chapters: Bussho (Buddha Nature); Daigo (Great Realization); Gyoji (Conduct and Observance); Inmo (This); and Shinjin-gakudo (Learning the Truth with Body and Mind). Book 2 maintains the highest standards of translation, with a clear style that rigorously follows the original words of Master Dogen. Ample footnotes, including Japanese and Chinese characters, explanatory text, and cross-references to other works, provide the reader with a wealth of supplementary information. Also included are a Sanskrit glossary of terms, and a list of Pinyin equivalents to the Japanese readings of Masters&#39; names. &#39;The water is clean, right down to the ground, Fishes are swimming like fishes. The sky is wide, clear through to the heavens, And birds are flying like birds. ...children and grandchildren of the Buddhist patriarchs should unfailingly learn in practice that sitting in Zazen is the one great matter. This is the authentic seal which is received and transmitted one-to-one.&#39;</p><p></p><h2>A Peaceful Retirement (Fairacre)</h2><p>Open the gate to Fairacre, America&#x2019;s favorite English village.<br><br>Having bid a last farewell to her pupils at Fairacre School, Miss Read settles down to what she hopes will be a relaxing retirement. It is not entirely so, of course. She finds herself as busy and in demand as ever: on holiday in Florence, helping with church and school affairs, and offering a kindly ear to her eccentric neighbors. With her teaching days behind her, Miss Read discovers her talent for writing, opening a new and exciting chapter in her life &#x2014; and bringing to a close her stories of life in Fairacre, the timeless English village beloved by millions of readers.</p><p><p><b>Miss Read</b> (1913-2012) was the pseudonym of Mrs. Dora Saint, a former schoolteacher beloved for her novels of English rural life, especially those set in the fictional villages of Thrush Green and Fairacre. The first of these, <i>Village School</i>, was published in 1955, and Miss Read continued to write until her retirement in 1996. In the 1998, she was awarded an MBE, or Member of the Order of the British Empire, for her services to literature.&nbsp;</p>Miss Read's books are like comfort food for the soul. The stories are wholesome, familiar and untroubling. In this story Miss Read leaves her job as schoolmistress of Fairacre School and settles down to retired life. She receives advice, volunteer work, writing assignments and the opportunity to be a marriage counselor. Sian Phillips, the distinguished actress, reads the story in a thoroughly professional, cultured manner. Hers is a solid, determined Miss Read and not a frail old lady who simply rests and roams about her gardens. For those seeking to return in spirit to a simpler place, this story about retirement in a Cotswold village is just the thing. D.L.G.

Traveling to India, he encounters the ancient esoteric order of mystic, wild, naked holy men known as the Naga Babas, the living source of the Hindu traditions of magic and yoga. Immersing himself in the teachings of the tradition, he receives an initiation and partakes in the Kumbh Mela, the largest spiritual gathering on Earth. With his evocative descriptions, Cederberg shows how traveling in India can be an overwhelming, even psychedelic experience. Everything in this ancient land is multiplied and manifold: people and things, sights and sounds, joy and suffering. Yet beyond the apparent confusion and chaos, a strange, subtle order begins to reveal itself. He starts to glimpse resemblances and analogies between the teachings of the Indian tradition and the Western traditions of magic, alchemy, and pagan pantheons. He meets a wide cast of characters, from mystical hucksters in Rishikesh and the veritable army of naked, chillum-smoking mystics of Maya Devi to Goa Gil, the world-renowned guru of the Goa techno-trance scene, and Mahant Amar Bharti Ji, an <i>urdhvabahu</i> or &#x201c;raised-arm Baba,&#x201d; who for more than 40 years has held up one arm in devotion to Shiva. <br><br>After extensive traveling and immersing himself in the extraordinary world of India, Cederberg returns to his native soil of Europe.

The train was packed to the hilt, and it was a small miracle that I had been able to secure a ticket the evening before. Unpleasantly hot even in the middle of the night, the train filled with sounds of rattling, snoring, and farts. I was on my way from Delhi via night train to Hardwar, a journey of only a little over 200 kilometers, which nevertheless took virtually all night. As I lay awake in the uppermost bunk in the shuffling train, having arrived in India the previous morning, I sensed something different from my past journeys here. Sometimes all the things one gathers and carries along with oneself can become a heavy load to bear. Perhaps this time I was here to let go of something, to cleanse myself of something. <br><br>As the train finally arrived, the bustling city of Hardwar looked surreal in the early morning twilight. Everywhere there were people, so many of them, and I had to step over sleeping bodies scattered on the ground to get anywhere. People from all over India, as well as from everywhere else in the world, kept arriving here in droves, train upon train, busload after busload, by vehicle or on foot. The roads were regularly closed to public traffic, which meant that you could not get into the city at all. Everywhere there were families, beggars, pilgrims, soldiers, and especially sadhus of all kinds. In the past sadhus were a relatively rare sight for me to behold, but now suddenly they were everywhere. They sat under trees and stared, with that haunting, otherworldly look that is characteristic to them. But all this was not really a surprise. The Kumbh Mela was after all a gathering of such magnitude that it was actually visible from space. And I, at heart a loner, who often felt crowded even in a room full of people, was now here in the midst of this raging, swarming mass of millions. <br><br>The origins of the Kumbh Mela festival are steeped in ancient history, going back to mythological events. Kumbh Mela is a composite of two words: kumbh from Sanskrit, meaning &#x201c;pitcher,&#x201d; and mela, meaning &#x201c;fair&#x201d; or &#x201c;gathering.&#x201d; The story goes that the gods and demons came together to churn the primordial ocean of milk for the greatest of treasures, amrit, the nectar of immortality, to be distributed to everyone afterward. However, one of the demons sneaked in line and stole the pitcher containing the amrit. Twelve days and nights (equal to twelve human years) the gods and demons fought over the pitcher. At one point Krishna flew away with the pot, accidentally spilling four drops from it that landed on earth. Those four places are now among the holiest in all of India--Prayag, Hardwar, Ujjain, and Nashik--and are the sites of the Kumbh Mela held every four years. At specific dates and times in these places, according to the position of the sun, moon, and stars, it is said that amrit appears. And on those dates everyone comes here to take a bath in the Ganga and to receive a drop of the amrit; millions and millions of people become pilgrims for those brief moments when the heavenly, death-conquering nectar is flowing, echoing a tradition from time immemorial. <br><br>In the middle of this storm of activity, amid the crowds and the hustle and bustle, there was a center of relative calm--the Juna Akhara. The Juna Akhara was the largest Akhara, or division, of the mystical, militant order of Naga Babas, reputedly founded in the prehistoric Treta age by Dattatreya, the naked one. They were finally organized into a proper order by Adi Shankara in the fifth century BCE in order to protect Sanatan Dharma, the Hindu religion--what the Naga Babas themselves view as the natural order of the universe. Centered around the Maya Devi temple, the Juna Akhara was a sprawling encampment of a literal army of Naga Babas--the naked ones, the wild, wandering mystics, the holy madmen of Shiva. Their encampments consisted of shacks built around the multitudes of <i>dhunis</i> (sacred fires) that were tended by an entourage of ghostly looking creatures. Stepping into the Akhara was like stepping into another time and another world--an extraordinary world, where all previous rules and rationality simply ceased to exist. <br><br>It was evening when I entered the Juna Akhara encampment for the first time. I approached the dhuni, surrounded by an entourage of Naga Babas, removed my shoes, and clasped my hands together, saying <i>&#x201c;Om Namo Narayan&#x201d;</i> to all those present. <i>&#x201c;OM NAMO NARAYAN!&#x201d;</i> came the booming chorus in response. I greeted, in the traditional way, first the dhuni and then the Babas presiding over it. The stern-looking Babas eyed me somewhat suspiciously as I paid my respects and received some water and ashes. I had brought some flowers, which I set decoratively at the sides of the dhuni, after which I sat down in silence. A few of the Babas finally nodded in smiling agreement. <br><br>My initial reaction to all of this of course, as I told Baba Rampuri a few days later, was a strong <i>&#x201c;What the fuck am I doing here?&#x201d;</i> It was all quite overwhelming and disorienting, suddenly bursting into this alien, foreign, fairytale world. Rampuri offered me an analogy for my situation. I was no longer my ordinary self, but a character, Adinath Puri, in a story written on the surface of the stars. The story was not a new one, but indeed the great story of all times: the story of the quest of the hero.</p><h2>Laika&#39;s Window: The Legacy of a Soviet Space Dog</h2><p>Laika began her life as a stray dog on the streets of Moscow and died in 1957 aboard the Soviet satellite Sputnik II. Initially the USSR reported that Laika, the first animal to orbit the earth, had survived in space for seven days, providing valuable data that would make future manned space flight possible. People believed that Laika died a painless death as her oxygen ran out. Only in recent decades has the real story become public: Laika died after only a few hours in orbit when her capsule overheated. <i>Laika&#x2019;s Window</i> positions Laika as a long overdue hero for leading the way to human space exploration.<br><br>Kurt Caswell examines Laika&#x2019;s life and death and the speculation surrounding both. Profiling the scientists behind Sputnik II, he studies the political climate driven by the Cold War and the Space Race that expedited the satellite&#x2019;s development. Through this intimate portrait of Laika, we begin to understand what the dog experienced in the days and hours before the launch, what she likely experienced during her last moments, and what her flight means to history and to humanity. While a few of the other space dog flights rival Laika&#x2019;s in endurance and technological advancements, Caswell argues that Laika&#x2019;s flight serves as a tipping point in space exploration &#x201c;beyond which the dream of exploring nearby and distant planets opened into a kind of fever from which humanity has never recovered.&#x201d;<br><br>Examining the depth of human empathy&#x2015;what we are willing to risk and sacrifice in the name of scientific achievement and our exploration of the cosmos, and how politics and marketing can influence it&#x2015;<i>Laika&#x2019;s Window</i>is also about our search to overcome loneliness and the role animals play in our drive to look far beyond the earth for answers.</p><p><b>Kurt Caswell<b></b> is a writer and professor of creative writing and literature in the Honors College at Texas Tech University, where he teaches intensive field courses on writing and leadership.

It must have been so, for along the eastern seaboard of the United States, and out over the Caribbean, out to the east of the islands of St. Thomas, Antigua, Martinique, Saint Lucia, Barbados, Trinidad, and on to British Guiana (now Guyana), and over a host of ships in the Atlantic positioned between 10 and 20 degrees north latitude, people gazing skyward saw a path of burning light. Some reported that they had seen a comet. Others said it was a meteor, the fiery path of a meteoroid burning in the Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere, what we like to call a shooting star. And still others reported they had seen a UFO.<br>But what those people witnessed was not a comet or a shooting star, and it was not a UFO. It was a phenomenon that had occurred only one other time in Earth&#x2019;s history: the reentry into Earth atmosphere of an artificial satellite, in this case the Soviet Union&#x2019;s second satellite, Sputnik II. On board was a small, white mongrel dog from the streets of Moscow. Her name was Laika. One of dozens of trained space dogs in the USSR&#x2019;s new space program, she was the first living being to orbit the Earth. And as the satellite Sputnik II came down, Laika was already dead. Her body, in a state of decay from the cooling and warming inside her capsule as it passed in and out of the influence of the sun, had been in orbit around the Earth for the previous five months, traveling at a speed of 17,500 miles per hour and making 2,570 revolutions. And as Sputnik II&#x2019;s orbit decayed, and it fell into the friction-wall of the atmosphere, it burned, and the world&#x2019;s first space traveler, Laika, burned with it.<br>Here in the 21st century, such satellite reentry events have become almost routine. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) reports that there are more than 21,000 artificial debris objects in Earth orbit larger than 10 cm, and a half million more measuring between one and ten centimeters. Even smaller objects, smaller than one centimeter, number over one hundred million. According to NASA, such debris includes derelict spacecraft, the upper stages of launch vehicles, payload carriers, debris intentionally released during mission operations, debris created by spacecraft or upper stage launch vehicle explosions and collisions, solid rocket motor effluent, and flecks of paint from various spacecraft or spacecraft parts released by thermal stress and small particle impacts. The space around our planet, like our planet itself, is awash in our garbage. This space junk burns up in the atmosphere all the time, some of it visible, some of it not, sometimes as planned by the object&#x2019;s creators (Russia&#x2019;s space station Mir in 2001, for example), and sometimes in its own time, or due to a loss of ground control (China&#x2019;s Tiangong-1 (which means Heavenly Palace) space station, which came down in 2018). The United States Space Command (USSPACECOM) tracks scheduled and nonscheduled reentries, and if you are in the right place at the right time, you might see one, if you can be bothered to look up.<br>But in 1958 when Sputnik II came down, such an artificial satellite reentry event had happened only once before, and that was Sputnik I, the first artificial satellite ever, which burned up in the atmosphere on January 4 of that year. The presence of something in orbit around the Earth that human beings had made was still in the realm of the fantastic. It occupied the fictional worlds of writers like Jules Verne and Arthur C. Clarke, and the imaginations of scientists like Russia&#x2019;s Konstantin Tsiolkovsky and America&#x2019;s Robert Goddard. And so fantastic was the idea of one of these satellites coming down so that you could see it come apart across the sky, Italian-born American astronomer L. G. Jacchia made a journey to various key points along the path of Sputnik II to interview people and collect data. He filed Special Report 15 with the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory titled &#x201c;The Descent of Satellite 1957 Beta One.&#x201d;<br>The story Jacchia tells is that in the early hours of April 14, Sputnik II fell out of orbit following a path from New York City to the mouth of the Amazon River. Observers in the eastern United States reported seeing a long, streaking tail pass overhead, not yet very bright, and followed by sparks, bursting and shuttering away. The burning satellite passed over Long Island and then went unreported for some five minutes, before being picked up again at about 23 degrees north latitude. By the time it reached Antigua in the Caribbean, it had fallen to about 50 miles above sea level (down from its orbit at about 131 miles perigee and 1,030 miles apogee), and it had become self-luminous, a fireball rivaling the brightness of the Moon. It fell, burning, pulling a long tail behind it, sparks flying off into the blackness. The head of that streak of light, the satellite itself, still carrying the dog Laika, glowed white with tinges of blues and greens through to the tail&#x2019;s yellowish fire that degraded to oranges and reds out to the end. Pieces of the satellite broke off and burned alongside the main body, before dimming and dropping away. Observers on one of the ships at sea, the Regent Springbok, reported that the satellite looked like the tail of a peacock, &#x201c;each particle glowing through the spectrum from white to a deep blue in magnificent display.&#x201d; When the satellite reached about eleven degrees north latitude, east of Trinidad and Tobago, and had fallen to about 35 miles altitude, it exploded in a fiery burst, like a great fireworks lightning up the dark. And in the moments after that burst, an eerie pale light was reported, illuminating the decks of ships at sea, and the sea around them. What was left of Sputnik II and the first space voyager, Laika, traveled on, falling and burning in its arc across the Atlantic and over Suriname and French Guiana, then onto the eastern shoulder of Brazil. As the satellite burned, the dog burned with it. The dry calcium phosphates of Laika&#x2019;s bones, the salts and minerals and the carbons of her body&#x2015;the very building blocks of life&#x2015;dissipated in the upper atmosphere to drift on stratospheric winds. Eventually, some of the matter that had once been Laika, now vaporized and elemental, rained down onto the Earth, where her life began. And somewhere out there headed toward the place where one of the great rivers of the world, the Amazon, meets the sea, Sputnik II vanished completely, still traveling fast above the horizon line. It burned out, and was re-consumed by the great black nothing of the cosmic dark. The entire event unfolded in about ten minutes.<br>*<br>In the year Sputnik II came down, the Soviet Union and the United States were locked in a bitter stalemate we know as the Cold War, a stalemate pitting Soviet communism and American capitalism against each other, and dominating political, economic, cultural, and even religious patterns between the two countries, and across our world. The year Sputnik II came down, the human population of our planet was just 2.9 billion. And because there were relatively so few of us, there was a whole lot more of everything else. More rhinos, more trees, and more clean water and air. The world was recovering from its second world war, and a growing middle class in countries like the United States and the United Kingdom moved us all forward into a global consumer economy the like of which had never been known before. It didn&#x2019;t have to go that way, but it did. Not in 200,000 years of the human story had so many people had so much. Not in 200,000 years. Not ever. And probably not ever again.<br>In 1958, the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC, now defunct) established the first transatlantic jet service, flying between New York and London. Such flights are routine in the 21st century, so much so that we call this astonishing feat of engineering and science, &#x201c;crossing the pond.&#x201d; The trip that took Columbus and his three ships over two months to achieve, was now possible in about eight hours, and available to most any middle-class citizen of any country in the world. And we have gone faster still. Astronauts on a space shuttle flight out of Cape Canaveral, Florida easily crossed the Atlantic in about nine minutes. Also in 1958, the European Economic Community (EEC) was established, the precursor of the European Union (EU). The New York Yankees defeated the Milwaukee Braves to win the World Series. Elvis was inducted into the US Army. And in the US, a stamp cost three cents, and a gallon of gas cost a quarter.<br>In 1958 Dwight Eisenhower was president of the United States, and Nikita Khrushchev was named the new Soviet premier. This was the year Russian novelist Boris Pasternak won the Nobel Prize in literature, but declined to accept the medal at the ceremony in Sweden under pressure from his nation&#x2019;s government. The Soviet Union had banned publication of Pasternak&#x2019;s novel Doctor Zhivago two years earlier. Meanwhile, the CIA was running a propaganda campaign, and played a central role in the novel&#x2019;s publication elsewhere to push its perceived anti-Soviet threads into the ring of global politics. This was also the year American pianist Van Cliburn won the first Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition, held in Moscow. His final performance of Tchaikovsky&#x2019;s Piano Concerto Number One, and Rachmaninoff&#x2019;s Piano Concerto Number Three brought the primarily Soviet audience to its feet, and they stood applauding for eight minutes. The competition was intended to bring Soviet cultural superiority to the world&#x2019;s stage, but instead that spotlight was stolen by an American, by a Texan no less, who <i>Time</i> magazine later touted on its May 19, 1958, cover: &#x201c;The Texan Who Conquered Russia.&#x201d; In this now famous story, the judges were compelled to ask Premier Khrushchev for permission to award first prize to an American. &#x201c;Is he the best?&#x201d; Khrushchev is said to have asked. The judges consented that he was. &#x201c;Then give him the prize,&#x201d; Khrushchev said.<br>The prize was given, and in fact, it was given on the very same ordinary Monday that Sputnik II came down. Clearly there was a lot going on that night, and clearly there was a lot going on in 1958. But Sputnik II, together with Sputnik I, towers above most everything else during that year, or during that decade, and arguably, during any decade before or since. That satellite with the little dog inside&#x2015;its launch, its orbit, and its burning in the atmosphere&#x2015;is one of the events that has redefined homo sapiens as a species. That event signals a singular moment of self-determination when we first left our planet home to venture into the cosmos, crossing into what Aldous Huxley, and Shakespeare before him, called a &#x201c;brave new world.&#x201d; Sputnik I and II are the first steps to humans becoming an inter-planetary species, to becoming Earth independent. In his book Soviet Space Exploration, William Shelton writes of Russian novelist Vladimir Orlov&#x2019;s determination that artificial satellites and spacecraft are artificial planets because they are populated by all manner of creatures from Earth, including humans. From the time of the first two Sputniks, humans have maintained a continuous presence in space, living and working in low-Earth orbit on various space stations, walking on the moon, and operating robotic rovers, telescopes, satellites, and probes as far out as Pluto, and even beyond. From artificial planets, then, we will continue on to colonize a natural planet, probably Mars. Indeed, private corporations and space agencies in a number of countries have their sights set on a crewed mission to Mars. And it may happen sooner than you think. &#x201c;There was a time,&#x201d; writes Orlov, &#x201c;when terrestrial life stepped over the threshold of the ocean and conquered the land; now it has stepped off the Earth to conquer the abyss of the cosmos.&#x201d;<br>What the Soviets did first, and what other nations would do after, resides at the zenith of our curiosity, because to be human is to be curious, to be human is to be an explorer. We cannot help but look outward to the next horizon, to the far-off and beyond, to the distant and the fantastic. We cannot help but dream. It is what we are, and what we do, and it tumbles from the source-root of our biological evolution. In his essay &#x201c;The First Earth Satellite,&#x201d; Sergei Khrushchev (son of then Soviet Premiere Nikita Khrushchev, and a rocket engineer in his own right) calls this source-root, &#x201c;the na�ve confidence that [we] are equal to anything.&#x201d; Human beings entered upon space exploration, Khrushchev writes, to prove to ourselves &#x201c;that [we] can touch the stars with [our] hand, that the Moon is only a stopping station, the first step, and that the next step is Mars, and after this anywhere. For me,&#x201d; he writes, the time of Sputnik &#x201c;was the best and the brightest time of my life.&#x201d; The Space Race, during those early years, and even now, writes Khrushchev, &#x201c;was a race not to the death, but to immortality.&#x201d;<br>*<br>Until Laika&#x2019;s flight, scientists did not know what would happen to a living organism outside the protection of Earth&#x2019;s atmosphere where there is no oxygen to breathe, weakened gravity, and increased radiation. What were the effects of solar radiation (from our sun), and cosmic radiation (from outside our solar system) on a living organism in orbit? The Van Allen belts had yet to be discovered, and their role, along with Earth&#x2019;s magnetic field, in shielding the Earth and its atmosphere from radiation, was not well understood. How long, scientists wanted to know, could a living organism survive in orbit? Five minutes? Three days? One year? No one knew. And what were the effects of microgravity, or weightlessness, on a living organism? Can the body&#x2019;s organ systems function in microgravity? Or does the whole thing just shut down? No one knew. Oleg Gazenko, a physician who helped select and train Laika, notes in an interview for the BBC documentary film, Space Dogs, that &#x201c;It was absolutely essential to have an answer to the question: was weightlessness really an insurmountable barrier to the chances of a human surviving any length of time in the conditions of space travel?&#x201d; And even if a human being can manage increased radiation and decreased gravity, can he survive the flight into space, can he survive the g-force of an accelerating rocket, and the violent vibration of that wild ride? No one knew. So before sending a human being into orbit, we sent Laika, a little white dog from the streets of Moscow, who would test these unknowns for us. &#x201c;Quite simply,&#x201d; writes Olesya Turkina in her book Soviet Space Dogs, &#x201c;without the first dog in space there would be no human space flight.&#x201d;<br>Laika rode into orbit on November 3, 1957. The USSR reported that she survived for about a week, returned a stream of valuable data that would help make human space flight possible, and then she died a painless death as her oxygen ran out. In a statement, Soviet Chief Designer Sergei Korolev announced that &#x201c;the data gathered on cosmic rays during the flight of Sputnik II [was] of great value&#x201d; and that &#x201c;the study of biological phenomena made during the space flight of a living organism&#x2015;something done for the first time in Sputnik II&#x2015;[was] of tremendous interest . . .

In <i>Loving the Poor, Saving the Rich</i>, Rhee produces what we have all been waiting for: a sensitive study that documents not just the 'what' but the 'why' of the important trajectory of a small and tentative Jesus movement within Greco-Roman society to an imperially endorsed and fiscally powerful church. This work sweeps beyond a mere historical study into the realms of inspiration. It is a sheer pleasure to read."<br>--<b>Wendy Mayer</b>, Centre for Early Christian Studies, Australian Catholic University<br><br>"In contrast to our modern world's way of talking about issues of wealth and poverty, Rhee takes us back to a time when confronting wealth and addressing the concerns of poverty were identity-forming experiences for the Christian church.

Because at the heart of addiction is the fear of painful emotional states, addicts compulsively seek drugs and alcohol to avoid or escape emotional pain. Mindfulness, on the other hand, helps us develop greater acceptance and ease with life&#x2019;s challenges, as well as greater self-compassion. <br><br>Here, Dr. Lawrence Peltz, who has worked as an addiction psychiatrist for nearly three decades, draws from his clinical experience and on the techniques of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) to explain the fundamental dynamics of addiction and the stages of the recovery process, and also gives us specific mindfulness exercises to support recovery.</p><p>Lawrence Peltz, MD, has worked as an addiction psychiatrist for more than two decades. He is the medical director of the Bournewood Caulfield Center, a drug and alcohol treatment facility in Woburn, Mass, and has been on the clinical faculty at both Harvard and Boston University Schools of Medicine.&nbsp; He is also a trained teacher of mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), and he speaks regularly to mental health professionals about mindfulness and recovery.<b>1 <br>&nbsp;<br>Addiction <br></b><i>I don&#x2019;t like you, but I love you.</i><br><i>Seems that I&#x2019;m always thinking of you.</i><br><i>You treat me badly, I love you madly. </i><br>&#x2014;Smokey Robinson <br>The essence of addiction is an attempt to manage an intolerable experience that we cannot avoid any other way. As we will see, people use drugs to change consciousness, which does work. However, once this mode of operating becomes a habit and then a way of life, changing consciousness transforms into avoiding suffering. This happens outside of awareness. Before long, addiction is causing suffering and eventually <i>is</i> suffering. It is also, ironically, an attempt to heal, to seek relief via getting high, medicating feelings, escaping how things are right now. It is a process that attempts to change reality and control experience so that it is more acceptable, palatable, bearable. <br>Addiction can be a container for fear, disappointment, confusion, grief, or anger. It allows us to move forward in life with some hope that we might actually feel pleasure, even happiness. Of course, the happiness never materializes and the pleasure is more anticipated than realized. The addict becomes increasingly discouraged, unable to stand his experience as he digs a deeper hole. Abstinence, if considered, is quickly rejected. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a total loser,&#x201d; he tells himself. &#x201c;Fuck it. My life is going nowhere anyway.&#x201d; <br>Roger completed day treatment after an alcohol detox and many years of drinking. He was committed to recovery and was able to stay sober until he became involved with a much younger woman he had met in the program. He relapsed with her, they ended badly, and he was back for another round of treatment, during which he learned something about his vulnerability in romantic relationships. <br>When Roger came back for a third time, it was not about drinking but gambling. He had been playing the slot machines regularly and, as a retiree on a fixed income, was courting financial ruin. Driving to the casino, Roger experienced the excitement and anticipation of winning, the fear of losing even more, the dread of facing his creditors, and a wish to escape what he eventually was able to identify as loneliness and desperation. His foray into gambling had begun much like his relationship with the young woman, his drinking, or any addictive process. Initially, he had a sense of power, a rigged game in which he felt in love, one up on everyone, no limits, totally in control of the situation. <br>Let&#x2019;s focus on the experience of falling in love. At the outset the lover is perfect in looks, reactions, speech&#x2014;a missing piece to complete us and fill us with the miracle of life and of our amazing fortune to have found this person. In fact, we often do fall in love with our opposite, or what Hal and Sidra Stone have called our &#x201c;disowned part.&#x201d; <br>Think of the attraction between the hard-driving, successful, somewhat obsessional man and the free-flowing, flirtatious woman. He loves her openness, creativity, ease with her sexuality, and she is drawn to his confidence, power, and organization. All is well until the honeymoon is over and it is necessary to engage in the business of life with the other person. Then, she or he is less perfect, annoying, and even impossible to communicate with at times. If mutual judgment proceeds unchecked, the couple will get further apart&#x2014;not an uncommon outcome. But with time, patience, and maturity, differences can be accepted and love deepens. It is no longer fantasy driven and is far more enduring and workable. <br>When we fall in love with a substance like cocaine or alcohol, there is also a sense of feeling complete and perfected. Addicts have repeatedly described an experience of infinite power and of being &#x201c;unstoppable.&#x201d; Once the glow is gone, however, there is no negotiation and, suddenly, significant constraints. The drug, in a true bait and switch, now demands enormous attention and time. As the addiction proceeds, it brings diminishing returns in terms of pleasure and costs increasingly more in money, relationships, health, and safety. <br>Of course we know there is no hope of discussing or bargaining with a drug, but there is more here than meets the eye. A disease process has begun that is progressive and takes over our ability to think clearly. Much as HIV infection attacks the immune system that is needed to defeat it, addiction compromises our brain and emotional capacities. As the addictive process evolves, there is a progressive atrophy of maturity and clarity. <br><b><br>Responsibility <br><br></b>Roger is an intelligent man. He was in serious debt and understood the futility of his actions. However, once he entered a relationship with a woman who was not committed to recovery, began driving to the casino, or took the first drink, he no longer had the capacity to make a reasoned judgment or a choice. <br>This is the flaw in Nancy Reagan&#x2019;s famous call to &#x201c;just say no.&#x201d; As the disease advances, the part of the mind that might be able to abstain is less functional and there are so many conflicting agendas that a reasoned judgment is nearly impossible. The heart closes, and the addict is living with blinders or in a tunnel. The capacity for responsibility, the <i>ability to respond </i>intelligently and decisively toward well-being, has been seriously impaired. <br>The process is insidious, almost imperceptible at first. Getting high on opiates for manageable money becomes getting high for a lot of money, then just getting straight for even more. An obese person does not come to weigh four hundred pounds in a few weeks. It occurs over a long period and depends on much denial and rationalizing. The pursuit of pleasure or relief becomes an end in itself, and other consequences are pushed away until it is no longer possible to do so. <br>Even then help is often not sought. Addicts wind up broke, alone, in prison, mentally ill, physically sick, or dead. I often tell our patients in the Bournewood-Caulfield Partial Hospitalization Program (who come for the day while living at home, a sober house, or residence) that they are a select group. These people either choose to come to day treatment following hospitalization or come because their outpatient therapy has not adequately stabilized them. Clearly, there are patients who are coerced to come by the legal system, their spouse, their boss, or financial circumstances, but they still have to be willing to be there. There is no locked door. Many addicts would never come to treatment, preferring to withdraw, hide, escape as long as possible. <br>Why is that? Why not seek help as an alternative to prison, illness, or death? I will give five possibilities, with considerable overlap among them: <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The person has lost the mental or emotional capacity to think clearly about his or her circumstances. <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He or she has become insulated from health-promoting information from the body or relationships. <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is too painful to face the physical discomfort, fear, shame, or grief. <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a history of unreliable health providers or caregivers in general. <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There is a deep sense of unworthiness to accept or receive help. <br>&nbsp;<br>Addiction progresses toward an absence of emotional intelligence, receptivity, and self-compassion. It promulgates the delusion that we are alone in a unique engagement with emotional pain and alienation. It is a hole that has no bottom. As the addiction to a substance or behavior becomes the only game in town, self-judgment and guilt increase, with only one mode of relief, however transient. The addict moves through discouragement, despair, self-hatred, resignation&#x2014; and the stories that emerge from these mind states only reinforce a sense of unworthiness of caring or help. <br>Many just die&#x2014;in a hospital, a prison, alone, and via accident, violence, or suicide. Beyond the one hundred thousand alcohol-related deaths, there are half a million from nicotine each year in the United States. I have seen patients with chronic lung disease die on respirators, and it is not pretty. Did they know this would happen? <br>The answer is yes and no. I once encountered an ex-patient that I had cared for as a medical student outside the Hines VA Hospital in Chicago. He was finally being discharged after recovering from extensive surgery. As I chatted with him and his wife, I was aware of smoke coming through the fist of his right hand. As it became clear that he was hiding his cigarette from me, he smiled sheepishly, and I wished him well. All he was doing was enjoying a cigarette and his freedom after several weeks in the hospital. But somehow he was ashamed, caught by the &#x201c;doctor.&#x201d; <br>Who is the doctor really, in this case? I believe it is his mature energy that takes responsibility for his own self-care. That part wanted to experience a robust sense of well-being and knew that smoking was not moving him in that direction. Another part just wanted to feel relief, whatever the cost. These were clearly in conflict and underscore the problem of addiction. It is &#x201c;normal&#x201d; to want to relax and feel better. We do it all the time by reading the newspaper, having a cup of coffee, turning on the TV, calling a friend. How is smoking a cigarette different from these? When does &#x201c;having a snack&#x201d; turn into overeating or bingeing on food? <br><b><br>Why Do People Use Drugs? <br></b><br>If you are considering or coming to treatment for addiction, you are likely feeling some combination of exhaustion, confusion, powerlessness, despair, and shame. But what is good about using cocaine, for example? With some encouragement, people will say things like &#x201c;The euphoria,&#x201d; &#x201c;I like the energy,&#x201d; &#x201c;I get focused,&#x201d; &#x201c;Sex is so much better,&#x201d; &#x201c;I am the man,&#x201d; &#x201c;I really don&#x2019;t know, it&#x2019;s pretty stupid,&#x201d; &#x201c;I think I am going to get high, but I just get paranoid.&#x201d; Highlighting the initial motivation for using a drug is the beginning of a conversation on the pluses and minuses and the presence of a conflict. This will be discussed in more detail in the section on the recovery process. There are many reasons why people use drugs, but all of them fall into three categories: <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get a feeling <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To get rid of a feeling <br>�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To escape <br>&nbsp;<br>Let&#x2019;s look at these one at a time. <br><i><br>Get a Feeling </i><br>Generally we want the &#x201c;positive&#x201d; feelings noted in the cocaine exam�ple above&#x2014;euphoria, energy, self-esteem, power. Some of these come directly from the use of the drug and can be particular to the individ�ual or setting. Alcohol can facilitate a buoyant mood or a simple calm�ing; opiates can bring deep relaxation or energy; cocaine provides intense stimulation or focus; marijuana can be experienced as a buzz or an enhancer of experience; hallucinogens can be speedy and a means to radically shift our perceptions. <br>Other feelings can come from the setting surrounding the drug. Heroin addicts come to methadone programs (and more recently bu�prenorphine providers) sick and depleted from years of hustling. Like professional athletes, many run out of gas in their mid- to late thirties, and the risks begin to outweigh the rewards. As medical director of a methadone program, I offered a deal &#x2014;&#x201c;We give you methadone, you come to treatment&#x201d;&#x2014;that was readily accepted. However, within three to six months, a significant number got depressed. This was partly because, for so many years, much of their energy, ingenuity, and creativity had gone into the street. It was a source of self-esteem and effectiveness, possibly providing an identity as hero, renegade, or desperado. Often the addict stayed in treatment to face the guilt, grief, and wreckage of her life. But there was a sense of loss at times mani�festing in war stories glorifying the lifestyle or drug. People became attached to the adrenaline rush, the risk, the experience of efficacy, the needle, or any aspect of the experience. <br>Often teenagers begin to use drugs and alcohol in their peer group in order to feel part of something. It seems to me that there are two universal human needs: to feel good about ourselves and to be�long. Some kids have never had either experience, and substance use, in one fell swoop, can appear to provide both. On the plus side, using together can create a bonding experience of fun, going outside the rules, and exploration or self-discovery. However, at some point the party is over, and if the person has not explored more mature modes of operating, he or she will either be alone or connect with another group of users. <br>In either case, the drug is likely to be the new vehicle for comfort, despite the fact that the original goal was to have friends. Sadly, ad�dicts can also become quite attached to &#x201c;negative&#x201d; feelings of shame and alienation. Though these feelings may not appear to be much fun, they can become the new hiding place or refuge. <br><i><br>Get Rid of a Feeling </i><br>Attempting to get rid of a feeling is what we have come to call &#x201c;self�medication,&#x201d; a term popularized by one of my early mentors, Edward Khantzian, a psychiatrist and researcher at the Cambridge Hospital. Dr. Khantzian&#x2019;s clinical experience demonstrated the association of certain drugs with particular intolerable mood states&#x2014;opiates for rage, cocaine for depression, alcohol and benzodiazepines for anxiety. One important discovery was that a number of cocaine users were treating poor attention and were actually able to focus and calm down on cocaine. Nicotine has the ability to either stimulate the mind or reduce anxiety depending upon the smoker&#x2019;s level of arousal. Appetite can be suppressed with nicotine and stimulants, enhanced by cannabis. <br>We do not like being bored, disappointed, agitated, depressed, angry, or in pain and want to change our consciousness. This is nor�mal, and substances have been used for this purpose for millennia. (It is notable that for some diseases, drugs are all that Western medicine has to offer.) Also available to us are food, sex, shopping, gambling, work, exercise, and many other modes that can alter an experience that feels intolerable. <br><i><br>Escape </i><br>Escaping has some similarity to getting rid of a feeling but is more global and possibly more unconscious. Did you ever not know what to do with yourself and either open the refrigerator or turn on the TV? Again, it is normal to take refuge in an ice-cream cone, a movie, a book, a bath, a nap, or a beer after a long day.

I was glad to be working even if it meant looking busy when there was not much to be done.<br>The dealers silently handed out cards at the ten or twelve tables that had any players. They don't let us wear watches, but we all knew what time it was exactly, and exactly when the next shift would take over our stations so we could return home to our loving spouses.<br>By the Tonga Bar, a man with shiny brown boots and a cowboy string tie was watching me. He had caught me by the quarter slots earlier, but I'd seen something I needed to do across the room. This time, he moved in fast. My back was against the wall and these thin, hard lips started whispering about his room upstairs. I pushed him off me, spilling his house bourbon, and Security came to the rescue.<br>I remember thinking it was a good thing it wasn't Anthony behind the mirrors, watching. He blames me when I get cornered.<br>That night I was working swing, which I usually like. Swing shift I get home about one in the morning, so I have afternoons to do the shopping and errands around town, but that night I felt bad, and it showed. I decided to shine a bunch of smiles around in my last ten minutes to make up for the rest of the night, maybe up the tips a little, even though underneath I felt like hell.<br>The last few minutes of my shift that night took forever. When Brenda showed up about ten after twelve, a few minutes late the way she always is, I ran into the employee lounge. Off with the black satin Playboy-bunny knockoff, which I folded and put into my cubby, off with the mesh stockings and heels, which I stuffed into a canvas bag. I washed some of the junk off my face, and got into warm leggings and my down coat. The parking lot at Prize's is just down from the mountains at Heavenly. You can't imagine the wind and cold some nights.<br>A couple of inches of new snow covered the ground by the time I got to our house. It's in the Tahoe Keys and we have a piece of the lake with a little dock in the backyard. No boat, though. We can always use Rick's. Anthony doesn't like owning anything he can borrow. I could see into the picture window through the heavy flakes. Anthony wasn't lying on the blue couch, but the fire was bright.<br>"I wanna love you night and day/ You know my love'll not fade away." The CD player boomed out ancient Rolling Stones, and when I heard it, I almost drove away. That music meant he was awake, drunk, and waiting for me. I sat watching the dashboard ice over long enough to hear him start his favorite song up again.<br>Anthony had left the door unlocked, so I sneaked in quietly. When I got inside, I could only see firelight, a few candles burning, orange flickers on the wall and a lot of shadows. I didn't see him and that was a relief. I took off my parka and sat down on the couch to take my boots off. I pulled too hard, and knocked a plate and fork onto the floor. The bedroom door opened.<br>"You're late, Misty," Anthony said. His feet made the parquet tiles crackle when he walked. He pulled the tie belt into a knot on the maroon silk robe from China he had filched from somewhere and dug around in the pocket. His hand came out with a crumpled cigarette pack that he stuffed back inside. His hair stuck out, and his eyes were puffy and red-rimmed. He walked over to turn off the music.<br>"I'll get you a drink."<br>"No, thanks."<br>"Take it." He jammed a stiff Yukon Jack into my hand and I knocked it down fast, saying to myself oh, what the hell, holding the glass out for another, feeling my face heat up. It takes two to make me brave.<br>"Anthony, I've got to tell you something."<br>He took hold of my chin and yanked my head up so I had to look at him. "Hurry up, now. I got work for you in bed," he said, like he hadn't heard me. His mouth turned down. He felt sorry for himself about something. It was a mood I hated.<br>"I'm not sleepy yet." My voice sounded like it sounds at work, calm no matter what. I was hearing a rap song over and over that some fake had bleated all night from the lounge beside the gambling room. I drank down the second drink and pulled off my sock.<br>"I guess you didn't hear me, huh?" He spread his hands, palms open. The robe split open onto dark hair and shapes. I tried to look away.<br>"You go on," I said.<br>"I figured something out," Anthony said. He slid his hands down my neck, over my breasts, then grabbed my shoulders with thick, security guard's hands. "You don't care, do you, Misty? You just don't care. You'll never love me how I love you. You're givin' it away, and I don't even get to take your boots off."<br>"You're drunk," I said.<br>"Tell me you love me, then. Dance with me."<br>I couldn't help it. I know I flinched when he touched me. "I want out." That's all I said. He knew what I meant.<br>"You bitch!" He was trying to get me to stand up. I just went limp.<br>When he spoke again, he was real quiet. "All day long I waited for you, thinking about how to make you love me." The way he was holding me I knew I would be black-and-blue in the morning. "You want it over with me, maybe. But I'm not through with you. I'll never be through with you."<br>And then he started the ritual, our good night scene, this part just like we had done it a million times before. "Bedtime," he said. He lifted me up, holding my arms down. I smelled whiskey on his breath and was scraped by stubble on his jaw when he pressed me against him.<br>I let myself drift off into the dream where I was someplace else, where it didn't matter what he did to my body. This time it didn't work. I felt pain from his hard fingers. I smelled his unwashed skin. I knew better but I couldn't stop myself; I struggled to get free. It wasn't part of the ritual.<br>He set me down and, still gripping me with his left hand, he gave me a hard knock in the head. When I opened my eyes again, I could see him looking down at me, breathing hard.<br>He was smiling, enjoying it. Like always.<br>Without thinking I reached behind him. My right hand connected with a crude carving of a polar bear, made out of gray rock, very heavy. I hit him in the back of the skull just right, with a nice, loose wrist, as if I had trained for this moment, solid as when you bowl, hitting the pins just off dead center for the strike.<br>His eyes closed and he fell forward. Then I saw the blood coming down onto his neck. I tried to catch him going down, but I dropped the statue on the table. Glass shattered and I swear the sound of it tore something apart in my brain. I managed to get him onto the couch, scared shitless, in a bad movie, knowing things had changed forever, already thinking about what he would do to me for this. He was moaning. I was too.<br>I left him on the couch while I ran for the cordless phone. It wasn't in the kitchen where it should be. I heard a thud, as though he had slipped down to the floor.<br>And then, what? I was so tired that night, tired and scared of him and sick of my life. I remember heading back toward the living room, but I guess I found my way to the bedroom instead. I don't even remember my head touching the pillow.The clock radio said seven-thirty. My head was killing me and I was still dressed under the covers. I pulled on a pair of grubby socks I found under the bed and went into the kitchen.<br>Then I saw the cordless phone on the floor by the stove. I remembered hitting him. I ran into the living room, burning myself when the coffee went flying. He wasn't on the couch. I was thinking, is this some new sick game of his? Is he hiding in the hall, or behind a door, ready to pay me back for the night before? I was careful as I checked around. Not a sound.<br>Outside, blinding April sun on fresh snow, Lake Tahoe out back just blazing blue against the sky, but no sign of Anthony. The footprints from last night were buried in the snow.<br>Back in the house, glass on the rug from the coffee table. Blood on the couch pillows. No polar bear statue.<br>No Anthony.</p><h2>Thin Places: Essays from In Between</h2><p><p><b>In this perceptive and provocative essay collection, an award-winning writer shares her personal and reportorial investigation into America&#x2019;s search for meaning</b><br><b></b><br><b></b>When Jordan Kisner was a child, she was saved by Jesus Christ at summer camp, much to the confusion of her nonreligious family. She was, she writes, &#x201c;just naturally reverent,&#x201d; a fact that didn&#x2019;t change when she&#x2015;much to her own confusion&#x2015;lost her faith as a teenager. Not sure why her religious conviction had come or where it had gone, she did what anyone would do: &#x201c;You go about the great American work of assigning yourself to other gods: yoga, talk radio, neoatheism, CrossFit, cleanses, football, the academy, the American Dream, Beyonc�.&#x201d; <br>A curiosity about the subtle systems guiding contemporary life pervades Kisner&#x2019;s work. Her celebrated essay &#x201c;Thin Places&#x201d; (<i>Best American Essays</i> 2016), about an experimental neurosurgery developed to treat severe obsessive-compulsive disorder, asks how putting the neural touchpoint of the soul on a pacemaker may collide science and psychology with philosophical questions about illness, the limits of the self, and spiritual transformation. How should she understand the appearance of her own obsessive compulsive disorder at the very age she lost her faith? </p><p>Intellectually curious and emotionally engaging, the essays in <i>Thin Places</i> manage to be both intimate and expansive, illuminating an unusual facet of American life, as well as how it reverberates with the author&#x2019;s past and present preoccupations.</p></p><p>Jordan Kisner's writing has appeared in <i>n+1</i>, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times Magazine</i>,<i> The Atlantic</i>,<i> GQ</i>,<i> The Guardian, The American Scholar</i>, <i>California Sunday</i>,<i> The New Yorker</i>, <i>The New Republic</i>, <i>New York </i>magazine, <i>Pop-Up Magazine,</i> and <i>Pitchfork</i>, among other publications.

[These] essays are as entertaining as they are eye-opening." <b>&#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></p><p>"Great writing begins not with the voice but with the eyes. Jordan Kisner has piercing vision, and she sees herself as keenly as she observes the teeming, chaotic world around her. She has a powerful voice, too, dispassionate and rhapsodic in equal measure. What results is a woundingly relevant book about American dreams and madness in the early twenty-first century." <b>&#x2015;</b><b>Alex Ross, author of <i>The Rest Is Noise </i>and <i>Listen to This</i></b></p><p>&#x201c;Jordan Kisner&#x2019;s essays are like intricate tattoos: etched with a sharp and exacting blade of intellect, but made of flesh; richly drawn in their details; comprised of equal parts pleasure and pain.

She ventures into the operating room where a surgeon inserts an electrode into a patient&#x2019;s brain. She mingles with the debutantes of Laredo, Texas as they navigate the fraught space between Wasp and Hispanic privilege. Wherever she is, Kisner probes the ambiguities that we live and dream, exploring the spaces where, in her words, 'Distinctions between you and not-you, real and and unworldly, fall away.' She is a tender but fierce writer; rigorous and wise." <b>&#x2015;Margo Jefferson</b>, author of <i>Negroland: A Memoir</i></p><p>"Jordan Kisner&#x2019;s essays are a bewitchingly original and highly personal synthesis of incisiveness, gracefulness, thoughtfulness, and selflessness. She is an intellectual empath with the deepest moral instincts and a willingness to consider herself alongside her subjects, as a person no more or less worthy of attention. Her work gives me the feeling that I&#x2019;m being told an urgent secret about humanity that is meant to be savored, then shared." <b>&#x2015;</b><b>Heidi Julavits</b>, author of <i>The Folded Clock</i></p><p>"Jordan Kisner sees reality with a telescopic, infrared focus uniquely suited to illuminating the hidden, forgotten, or obscured nooks of our cultural moment, excavating the longings and unspoken affinities that lie just beneath the surface.

Today many species continue to thrive in the lush ancient forest. </p><p> Superbly illustrated with more than 80 color photographs, <i>The Birds of Kauai</i> covers every avian species that can be seen on the Garden Island. The author's knowledge and enthusiasm are evident on each page as he describes native forest birds, seabirds, alien birds, and migratory visitors. One of world's rarest birds is the Kaua'i 'O'o, the victim of predation and extensive changes to its environment.

This lyrical collection of select published and unpublished works traces his struggle with the particular manifestations of violence and hatred that mark the twentieth century. His words remind us all that out of religious faith emerges social responsibility and the power to transform lives.</p><p>Howard Thurman is hard to lionize because he's hard to categorize. He was a minister to Martin Luther King Jr. and an academic at Boston University, and he has been posthumously interpreted as a mystic, a political visionary, and a model of parish ministry. "Human life is one and all men are members of one another," Thurman wrote. "And this insight is spiritual and it is the hard core of religious experience." Such statements make him as useful to black Baptists as he is to white Unitarians, which probably explains why his writings have not been packaged by the niche-marketing-obsessed publishing industry as well as they should have been--until now. <i>A Strange Freedom: The Best of Howard Thurman on Religious Experience and Public Life</i>, an anthology edited by Walter Earl Fluker and Catherine Tumber, collects Thurman's meditations on everything from the universal vocational dilemma (in an essay called "What Shall I Do with My Life?") to his specific observations on the legacy of Dr. King (in a radio obituary delivered on the evening of King's assassination). Among the most striking and original aspects of Thurman's faith is his insistence on the political significance of Christian mystical experience. In essays such as "The Fellowship Church of All Peoples," he shows how a mystical experience of human unity can strengthen an individual's moral imagination in a way that has precise political consequences. In a world where public life often dismisses religion as personal affective disorder, Thurman's writings may fuel a purging and productive fire in the bones. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Walter Earl Fluker is professor of philosophy and religion and executive director of the Leadership Center at Morehouse College and founder of VisionQuest Association, Inc.

His work will surely prove indispensable."</p> (<i>Church Times</i>)<br><br><p> "The analyses of the Sermon on the Mount and Letters of St. Paul are very informative, and the range of anarchist interpretations is presented with remarkable clarity... As a compendium of viewpoints within the general heading of 'Christian Anarchism', Christoyannopoulos's book is both useful and original."</p> (Tom Grimwood <i>The European Legacy</i>)<br><br><p> <em>"Christian Anarchism</em> will be of interest to Christians, theologians, anarchists and historians of political thought... On its own terms it achieves its aim of synthesising a range of Christian anarchist writings and demonstrating that Christian anarchism is a coherent school of thought."</p> (Daniel Duggan <i>Political Studies Review</i>)<br><br><p> "an excellent and original book which deserves a reading by anyone interested in anarchism, radical Christianity or the politics of non-violence."</p> (Paul Chambers <i>Anarchist Studies</i>)<br><br><p> "Dr Christoyannopoulos has produced a superb discussion of Christian anarchism from Tolstoy to the present day. He combines a wide scope and meticulous scholarship with impressive analytical ability. He also writes clearly and well &#x2013; not always the case in this area. This book is required reading for those interested in alternative conceptions of politics."</p> (Professor David McLellan)<br><br><p> "As a Christian, I found that the ideas were presented in an easily digestible form and it was easy to follow the lines of thinking that led these writers into their theories of Christian anarchism. Whilst I didn't find myself agreeing with many of the ideas, it's testament to the amount of research that has gone into the book that I could understand them well enough to disagree with them, as I had little knowledge of the subject before reading."</p> (<i>Bookbag</i>)<br><br><p> "Alexandre Christoyannopoulos's engaging and intelligent study of Christian anarchism directly confronts the perception that these two traditions of thought are incompatible. At the heart of this scholarly discussion is the work of Tolstoy but the analysis is enriched by an examination of a much wider range of writers and movements. Anyone interested in the vital issues of non-violence, the limits of political obligation, resistance, compassion and justice will find this book enormously illuminating."</p> (Dr Ruth Kinna)<br><br><p> "There is much of interest in this book, however, particularly for scholars interested in political theology. its concise description and synthesis make the themes and debates within Christian anarchist writings much more accessible than they have been previously."</p> (Christopher Craig Brittain <i>Modern Believing</i>)</p><h2>Seven Deadly Shadows</h2><p><p><strong>This thrilling YA retelling of Kurosawa&#x2019;s <em>Seven Samurai</em> features a girl tasked with saving the world from eternal darkness.

Even one of the men who authorized his assassination, the Emperor Octavian, admitted to his grandson that Cicero was: 'an eloquent man, my boy, eloquent and a lover of his country'. This new selection of speeches illustrates Cicero's fierce loyalty to the Roman Republic, giving an overview of his oratory from early victories in the law courts to the height of his political career in the Senate. We see him sway the opinions of the mob and the most powerful men in Rome, in favour of Pompey the Great and against the conspirator Catiline, while The Philippics, considered his finest achievements, contain the thrilling invective delivered against his rival, Mark Antony, which eventually led to Cicero's death.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

He was taken to Rome for his education with the idea of a public career and, by the year 70, he had established himself as the leading barrister in Rome. In the meantime, his political career was well under way and he was elected praetor in 66. In addition to his speeches, Cicero produced a large number of works on the theory and practice of rhetoric, on religion, and on moral and political philosophy. He was put to death in 43 BC.

The miracle of <i>Evolution</i> is that it makes the triumph of life, which is its story, sound like the real story.&#x201d;<b>&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post Book World</i></b></p><p>Following up his cosmic Manifold series, Stephen Baxter peers back on a more prosaic history in the worthy yet uneven <i>Evolution</i>. The book is nothing less than a novelization of human evolution, a mega-Michener treatment of 65 million years starring a host of smart, furry primates representing <i>Homo sapiens</i>'s ancestry. Each stage of our ancestry is represented by a character of progressively increasing intelligence, empathy, and brain size, who must survive predation and other perils long enough to keep the natural-selection ball rolling. While Baxter carefully follows some widely accepted theories of evolution--punctuated equilibrium, for instance--he also strays from the known in postulating air whales and sentient, tool-wielding dinosaurs. And why not? There's nothing in the fossil record to contradict his musings about those things, or about the first instances of mammalian altruism and deception, which he also lets us observe. From little Purga, a shrewlike mammal scurrying under the feet of ankylosaurs, all the way through Ultimate, the last human descendant, Baxter adds drama and a strong story arc to our past and future. But he spends too much time on details of the various prehumans' lives, which can become repetitive: fight, mate, die, ad infinitum. And readers eager for a science-fictional adventure will only find satisfaction in the posthuman chapters at the end. Despite these flaws, <i>Evolution</i> grips the attention with an epoch-spanning tale of the random changes that rule our genetic heritage.

Now, through this honest and wry exploration of her own life, Goldberg puts her teachings to work.</p></p><p><p>Natalie Goldberg is the author of ten books, including <em>Writing Down the Bones</em>, which has sold over one million copies and has been translated into twelve languages. She has also written the beloved <em>Long Quiet Highway: Waking Up in America</em>, a memoir about her Zen teacher. For the last thirty years she has practiced Zen and taught seminars in writing as a spiritual practice. She lives in northern New Mexico.</p>"Of course, we are drawn to teachers that unconsciously mirror our own psychology," writes Goldberg in a memoir about her wrestling match with her particular devil. In <i>Writing Down the Bones</i>, she coupled writing with the insights of Zen Buddhism, showing writers how to use a stream of consciousness approach to move through blocks and understand their true experience. Here, however, as Goldberg explores the link between her elegant Zen master, Katagiri Roshi, and the gritty, charming bartender father who sexually violated her, she inadvertently demonstrates this approach's shortcoming. Years after his death, Goldberg learned that Katagiri, the teacher who taught her so much (and the subject of <i>Long Quiet Highway</i>), carried on affairs with female students. Goldberg was shattered; she'd wanted to believe he was an immaculate refuge. Liberation through disillusionment is a universal and durable theme, yet as Goldberg muses and tells stories&#x2014;splicing in a long Zen tale for a little extra-dimensional oomph&#x2014;her account closes rather than opens up. In spite of her fluid writing and honesty, the work feels insular and self-cherishing, like personal notes rather than a compelling narrative for the rest of us. Many readers will conclude that this is a not-so-great failure after all, or perhaps a heartache that hasn't really healed. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Humanity has engineered a hard-won golden age, forged in the aftermath of a bitter conflict that wiped both religion and nation state from the planet. Now seven factions or &#39;hives&#39; co-govern the world, their rule fuelled by benign censorship, oracular statistical analytics and technological abundance. But this is a fragile Utopia - and someone is intent on pushing it to breaking point. Convicted for his crimes, celebrated for his talents, Mycroft Canner is the indentured instrument - and confidant - of some of the world&#39;s most powerful figures. When he is asked to investigate a bizarre theft, he finds himself on the trail of a conspiracy that could shatter the tranquil world order the Hives have maintained for three centuries. But Mycroft has his own secrets. He is concealing a much greater threat to the seven Hives, a wild card no degree of statistical analysis could have prophesised. This threat takes the unlikely form of a thirteen-year-old called Bridger. For how will a world that has banished God deal with a child who can perform miracles?</p><p>Ada Palmer is an author, historian and composer. She did her PhD at Harvard, teaches History at the University of Chicago, blogs at ExUrbe.com, composes close harmony folk music and performs with the a capella group Sassafrass.Palmer's fiction debut is the ambitious and colorful first installment of her Terra Ignota series, following the political intrigues of Mycroft Canner, a convict who, as punishment for his crimes, becomes the servant of all he meets. The setting is a richly depicted future where gender is concealed, people live in carefully coded sects, and theology is pick-and-choose. Mycroft is tasked with hiding a child whose existence could cause chaos; this is no easy feat, and he and those around him are soon plunged into the world of high politics. Palmer's prose is written with an Enlightenment sensibility, deliberately dense and ponderous. This stylistic decision can be engaging, especially in the tête-�&nbsp;-têtes between Mycroft and the reader, but the heaviness detracts from what might otherwise be an engrossing plot. Mycroft is a witty unreliable narrator whose own biases color the world brought before the reader; it lurches between hellish and utopian. Palmer proves that the boundaries of science fiction can be pushed and that history and the future can be married together. Agent: Amy Boggs, Donald Maass Literary.

They also announce the return of the dashing Montefierrow twins to New York after a twelve-year sojourn in Europe. But there is more to this story than what&#x2019;s reported, which becomes clear when the three meet one evening during a walk, and their polite conversation quickly takes a menacing turn. The twins are seeking a rare and powerful gem and they believe it&#x2019;s stashed in the unused apartment where Griselda is staying. Baffled by the request, she pushes them away, but they won&#x2019;t take no for an answer. When they return, accompanied by Griselda&#x2019;s long-estranged younger sister, the murders begin...</p><p>Drenched in the glamour and luxury of the New York elite, <em>The So Blue Marble</em> is a perfectly Art Deco suspense novel in which nothing is quite as it seems. While different in style from her later books, Dorothy B. Hughes&#x2019;s debut highlights her greatest strengths as an author, rendered with both the poetic language and the psychology of fear for which she is known today.</p></p><p><p>Dorothy B. Hughes (1904&#x2013;1993) was a mystery author and literary critic. Born in Kansas City, she studied at Columbia University and won an award from the Yale Series of Younger Poets for her first book, the poetry collection <em>Dark Certainty</em> (1931). After writing several unsuccessful manuscripts, she published <em>The So Blue Marble</em> in 1940, winning praise for its terse, hard-boiled prose.</p><p>Hughes published thirteen more novels, the best known of which are <em>The Fallen Sparrow</em> (1942), Ride the Pink Horse (1946),&nbsp;<em>In a Lonely Place</em> (1947). All three were made into successful films. In the early fifties, Hughes largely stopped writing fiction, preferring to focus on criticism, for which she would go on to win an Edgar Award. In 1978, the Mystery Writers of America presented Hughes with the Grand Master Award for literary achievement.</p><p>Otto Penzler, the creator of American Mystery Classics, is also the founder of the Mysterious Press (1975), a literary crime imprint now associated with Grove/Atlantic; Mysterious Press.com (2011), an electronic-book publishing company; and New York City&#x2019;s Mysterious Bookshop (1979). He has won a Raven, the Ellery Queen Award, two Edgars (for the <em>Encyclopedia of Mystery and Detection</em>, 1977, and <em>The Lineup</em>, 2010), and lifetime achievement awards from Noircon and <em>The Strand Magazine</em>. He has edited more than 70 anthologies and written extensively about mystery fiction.</p>&#x201c;A movie star&#x2013;turned-designer gets swept into a murderous hunt for a precious gem in this reissued 1940s thriller.<br><br> Griselda Satterlee (not, thank God, her screen name) has decided to give up the screen for the comparatively quieter life of fashion design. During a trip to New York, which will reunite her with her two sisters and find her staying in her ex-husband's digs near Madison Avenue, Griselda returns home one night only to be accosted by the Montefierrow twins, denizens of the society page, back in town after a dozen years on the Continent, and as thoroughly, chillingly, cold-bloodedly homicidal a pair as has appeared in any thriller. The twins insist that Griselda's ex is in possession of a rare and ancient gem, which they call the blue marble, and insist she knows where it is. Her own insistence that she has no idea spurs the twins to a series of vicious murders, made even more horrible by the alternately gleeful and bored participation of Griselda's conscienceless, psychopathic younger sister. Some of the murders are committed to extract information and some just to tidy up loose ends. But as with everything else in the rather intricate plot, the particulars drop away and the motive, far more than obtaining the marble, becomes the desire for mayhem and casual sadism, all of it executed as casually as ordering another round. Nearly 80 years after its initial publication, there is still nothing like Hughes' (The Expendable Man, 1963, etc.) debut novel. The 1940s New York setting, the characters who drink like fish and dress for dinner and take cabs to go a block&#x2015;because, really, who walks?&#x2015;give the book the sophisticated luster of romantic comedy. But it's as if a Lubitsch movie kept being periodically taken over by David Lynch. It remains funny only now we're being asked to laugh at murder and threats and oddball sociopaths.

Yet just over 10 percent of the public knows they even exist; and for those who are aware of them, as well as even those who seek grants from them, their internal workings remain a complete mystery. Joel Fleishman knows the sector like few others, and in this groundbreaking book he explains both the history of foundations&#x2014;with their fledgling beginnings in the era of the robber barons seeking social respectability&#x2014;through to the present day. This book shows how, why foundations matters, and how the future of foundations can provide a vital spur to the engine of the American, and the world's, economy&#x2014;if they are properly established and run.</p><p><b>Joel L. Fleishman</b> is Professor of Law and Public Policy at Duke University. From 1993 to 2001, Mr. Fleishman served as President of the Atlantic Philanthropic Service Company, the U.S. affiliate of Atlantic Philanthropies.In his first book, law professor and philanthropist Fleishman has created a thoughtful, engrossing, comprehensive guide to the origins, initiatives, successes and failures among the largely unsung 68,000 private foundations in America, which together grant over 32.2 billion tax-exempt dollars per year. Tracing the history of this distinctly American institution, Fleishman considers the philanthropy of such financial titans as Andrew Carnegie, George Soros, Warren Buffett, Michael Milken and Bill Gates. Fleishman's view of the foundation is distinctly favorable: foundations serve a vital social function by providing seed funding to innovative initiatives, having led to such benefits as the 911 emergency response system, the development of the Pap smear, the alleviation of poverty in Bangladesh and the establishment of Johns Hopkins and Carnegie Mellon Universities. Fleishman doe not hestitate, however, to criticize foundations for arrogance, poor planning, unresponsiveness, waste and irresponsibility, using 12 case studies-Rockefeller's Population Council and the Children's Television Workshop among them-to set the stage for "Some Not So Modest Proposals," most of which involve increasing transparency and accountability. Fleishman's efforts prove an illuminating guide to a little-examined aspect of the American tradition.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The book provides not only amusement, but a commentary on how America has changed, and a celebration of those places that have been forgotten by conventional history.</p><p>You know those old postcards that show the local meatpacking factory in all its cinder-block glory or the sickening color scheme of a cheap '70s motel room? Well, here they are. Beginning with panoramas of highways in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, and other U.S. states, <i>Boring Postcards</i> segues to truck stops, restaurants, motor inns, malls, airports, military bases, factories, tools, and automobiles. Every image is certifiably boring, whether by dint of a photographer's ineptitude (dead-on views taken from too far away) or the sorry state of corporate architecture and interior design. And yet, as earnest advertisements for the American Way of Life, they all radiate a sunny faith in the uniqueness and desirability of whatever they portray.<p> There's not a word of commentary in this book, but that part is up to you. Certain things begin to stand out as you flip through the pages. Like the always blue skies. (Positive thinking!) Or the potentially interesting details that are uniformly obliterated, thanks to those polite middle-distance views and the muddy qualities of cheap lithography. There's a weird tension between the blandly generic ("Fine Food" reads the only visible sign atop a low-slung white building) and the proudly local (according to the postcard caption, this is "The famous Blue Grill on U.S. 40, St. Elmo, Ill."). In its silently subversive way, <i>Boring Postcards</i> proposes that we look more closely at this hallowed form of marketing to see what it tells us about the values and standards of mainstream American culture. <i>--Cathy Curtis</i></p>The work of Martin Parr bridges the divide between art and documentary photography.

From pithy reflections on tone, technique, and the thorny matter of thumbs to ruminations on how such a machine could be the voice and repository of priceless human messages both lyrical and complex, <i>Piano Pieces</i> examines the current status of music, piano-playing, and pedagogy through the noisy filter of contemporary culture.</p></p><p><p><b>Russell Sherman</b> is an internationally renowned classical pianist who has performed with the country's leading orchestras. He was born in New York City and lives in Lexington, Massachusetts. He teaches at the New England Conservatory.</p>Sherman is a noted concert pianist and music teacher who confesses, at the outset of this collection of observations on pianism, music in general and society at large, that he is lazy. Yet, he feels driven to offer "the diary of an old and unregenerate crust." The result is not so much an organized book as a collection of reflections and aphorisms arranged roughly into sections dealing with the essence of piano technique, the teaching of it, the world in which pianism is taught today and thoughts on works of the masters. Sherman is a man of considerable erudition and much wit, whose description of the pianist's finger functions is brilliant, both poetic and allusive. If in assessing the desired pianistic qualities he sometimes becomes too technical for most lay readers, this is redeemed by salty salvos at such betes noirs as piano competitions and electronic popular culture. He fears a whole generation is being lost to the pleasures of serious music, and only the current interest in environmentalism gives him the faintest hope for the future of the species. Reading a book in endless brief bites can be wearing, however, and it seems a pity that Sherman couldn't bring himself to put his very worthwhile thoughts into a more coherent, cohesive framework. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Murder in the Blood: A Doyle &amp; Acton Murder Mystery (The Doyle &amp; Acton Murder Series)</h2><p>This homicide case featured aristocrats as far as the eye could see, between the Russians and the Spaniards&#x2014;and Acton, of course, who was supposedly investigating the others but seemed a little too deferential, for Doyle&#x2019;s taste.

Satisfied nothing was going to fly out on the three-hour drive to Idlewilde, I shut the tailgate and wiped my hands on my cutoffs.<br> <br>My cell phone blared Rod Stewart crooning, &#x201c;If you want my body,&#x201d; and I held off answering for a moment so I could belt out the &#x201c;and you think I&#x2019;m sexy&#x201d; part along with Rod. Across the street, Mrs. Pritchard slammed her living room window shut. Honestly. I couldn&#x2019;t let a perfectly good ringtone go to waste.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, girl,&#x201d; Korbie said, snapping her bubble gum through the phone. &#x201c;We on schedule or what?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tiny snag. Wrangler&#x2019;s out of room,&#x201d; I said with a dramatic sigh. Korbie and I had been best friends forever, but we acted more like sisters. Teasing was part of the fun. &#x201c;I got the sleeping bags and gear in, but we&#x2019;re going to have to leave behind one of the duffels: navy with pink handles.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You leave my bag, and you can kiss my g-ass money good-bye.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Should&#x2019;ve known you&#x2019;d play the rich-family card.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve got it, flaunt it. Anyway, you should blame all the people getting divorced and hiring my mom. If people could kiss and make up, she&#x2019;d be out of a job.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And then you&#x2019;d have to move. Far as I&#x2019;m concerned, divorce rocks.&#x201d;<br> <br>Korbie snickered her amusement. &#x201c;I just called Bear. He hasn&#x2019;t started packing yet but he swears he&#x2019;s gonna meet us at Idlewilde before dark.&#x201d; Korbie&#x2019;s family owned Idlewilde, a picturesque cabin in Grand Teton National Park, and for the next week, it was as close to civilization as we were going to get. &#x201c;I told him if I have to clear bats out of the eaves by myself, he can count on a long, chaste spring break,&#x201d; Korbie added.<br> <br>&#x201c;I still can&#x2019;t believe your parents are letting you spend spring break with your boyfriend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well&#x2014;&#x201d; Korbie began hesitantly.<br> <br>&#x201c;I knew it! There is more to this story.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Calvin is coming along to chaperone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>Korbie made a gagging noise. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s coming home for spring break and my dad is forcing him to tag along. I haven&#x2019;t talked to Calvin about it, but he&#x2019;s probably pissed. He hates it when my dad tells him what to do. Especially now that he&#x2019;s in college. He&#x2019;s going to be in a horrible mood, and I&#x2019;m the one who has to put up with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>I sat on the Jeep&#x2019;s bumper, my knees suddenly feeling made of sand. It hurt to breathe. Just like that, Calvin&#x2019;s ghost was everywhere. I remembered the first time we kissed. During a game of hide-and-seek along the riverbed behind his house, he&#x2019;d fingered my bra strap and shoved his tongue in my mouth while mosquitoes whined in my ears.<br> <br>And I&#x2019;d wasted five pages recording the event ad nauseam in my diary.<br> <br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be back in town any minute,&#x201d; Korbie said. &#x201c;It sucks, right? I mean, you&#x2019;re over him, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So over him,&#x201d; I said, hoping I sounded blas�.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want it to be awkward, you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Please. I haven&#x2019;t thought about your brother in ages.&#x201d; Then I blurted, &#x201c;What if I keep an eye on you and Bear? Tell your parents we don&#x2019;t need Calvin.&#x201d; The truth was, I wasn&#x2019;t ready to see Calvin. Maybe I could get out of the trip. Fake an illness. But it was my trip. I had worked hard for this. I wasn&#x2019;t going to let Calvin ruin it. He&#x2019;d ruined too many things already.<br> <br>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t go for it,&#x201d; Korbie said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s meeting us at Idlewilde tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Tonight? What about his gear? He won&#x2019;t have time to pack,&#x201d; I pointed out. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve been packing for days.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is Calvin we&#x2019;re talking about. He&#x2019;s, like, half mountain man. Hold up&#x2014;Bear is on the other line. I&#x2019;ll call you right back.&#x201d;<br> <br>I hung up and sprawled in the grass. Breathe in, breathe out. Just when I&#x2019;d finally moved on, Calvin was back in my life, dragging me into the ring for round two. I could have laughed at the irony of it. He always did have to have the final say, I thought cynically.<br> <br>Of course he didn&#x2019;t need time to prepare&#x2014;he&#x2019;d practically grown up hiking around Idlewilde. His gear was probably in his closet, ready at a moment&#x2019;s notice.<br> <br>I rewound my memory several months, to autumn. Calvin was five weeks into his freshman year at Stanford when he dumped me. Over the phone. On a night when I really needed him to be there for me. I didn&#x2019;t even want to think about it&#x2014;it hurt too much to remember how that night had played out. How it had ended.<br> <br>Afterward, taking pity on me, Korbie had uncharacteristically agreed to let me plan our upcoming senior spring break, hoping it would cheer me up. Our two other closest friends, Rachel and Emilie, were going to Hawaii for spring break. Korbie and I had talked about spending our break with them on the beaches of Oahu, but I must have been a glutton for punishment, because I said adios to Hawaii and announced that in six months we would be backpacking the Tetons instead. If Korbie knew why I&#x2019;d chosen the Tetons, she had the sensitivity not to bring it up.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d known Calvin&#x2019;s spring break would overlap ours, just like I&#x2019;d known how much he loved hiking and camping in the Tetons. I&#x2019;d hoped that when he heard about our trip, he&#x2019;d invite himself along. I desperately wanted time with him, and to make him see me differently and regret being stupid enough to give me up.<br> <br>But after months of not hearing from him, I&#x2019;d finally gotten the message. He wasn&#x2019;t interested in the trip, because he wasn&#x2019;t interested in me. He didn&#x2019;t want to get back together. I let go of any hope of us and hardened my heart. I was done with Calvin. Now this trip was about me.<br> <br>I closed my mind to the memory and tried to think through my next steps. Calvin was coming home. After eight months, I was going to see him, and he was going to see me. What would I say? Would it be awkward?<br> <br>Of course it would be awkward.<br> <br>I was ashamed that my next thought was so incredibly vain: I wondered if I&#x2019;d gained any weight since he&#x2019;d last seen me. I didn&#x2019;t think so. If anything, the running and weight lifting I&#x2019;d done to prepare for our backpacking expedition had sculpted my legs. I tried to cling to the idea of sexy legs, but it wasn&#x2019;t making me feel any better. Pretty much, I felt like throwing up. I couldn&#x2019;t see Calvin now. I&#x2019;d thought I&#x2019;d moved on, but all the pain was surging back, swelling in my chest.<br> <br>I forced a few more deep breaths, composing myself, and listened to the Wrangler&#x2019;s radio playing in the background. Not a song, but the weather report.<br> <br>&#x201c;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. two storm systems set to hit southeastern Idaho. By tonight, the chance of rain will rise to ninety percent, with thunderstorms and strong winds possible.&#x201d;<br> <br>I perched my sunglasses on top of my head and squinted at the blue sky stretching from one horizon to the other. Not a wisp of cloud. Just the same, if rain was coming, I wanted to be on the road before it hit. Good thing we were leaving Idaho and driving ahead of the storm, into Wyoming.<br> <br>&#x201c;Daddy!&#x201d; I hollered, since the house windows were open.<br> <br>A moment later he came to the front door. I craned my neck to look at him and put on my best little girl pout. &#x201c;I need money for gas, Daddy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What happened to your allowance?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I had to buy stuff for the trip,&#x201d; I explained.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hasn&#x2019;t anyone told you money doesn&#x2019;t grow on trees?&#x201d; he teased, observing me with a patronizing shake of his head.<br> <br>I jumped up and kissed his cheek. &#x201c;I really need gas money.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course you do.&#x201d; He opened his wallet with the softest of sighs. He gave me four faded, rumpled twenties. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t let the gas tank drop below a quarter full, you hear? Up in the mountains, gas stations start to thin. Nothing worse than getting stranded.&#x201d;<br> <br>I pocketed the money and smiled angelically. &#x201c;Better sleep with your cell phone and a tow rope under your pillow, just in case.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Britt&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Only kidding, Daddy,&#x201d; I said, giggling. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t get stranded.&#x201d;<br> <br>I swung into the Wrangler. I&#x2019;d dropped the top, and the sun had done a fine job of warming my seat. Sitting taller, I checked my reflection in the rearview mirror. By the end of summer, my hair would be as pale as butter. And I&#x2019;d have added ten new freckles to the ranks. I&#x2019;d inherited German genes from my father&#x2019;s side. Swedish from my mother&#x2019;s. Chance of sunburn? One hundred percent. Lifting a straw hat off the passenger seat, I squashed it on my head. But dang it all, I was barefoot.<br> <br>Perfect attire for 7-Eleven.<br> <br>Ten minutes later, I was in the store, filling a cup with Blue Raspberry Slurpee. I drank some off the top and refilled it. Willie Hennessey, who was working the register, gave me the evil eye.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good grief,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Help yourself, why don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Since you offered,&#x201d; I said cheerfully, and stuck the straw between my lips once more before refilling.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m supposed to keep law and order in here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Two little sips, Willie. Nobody&#x2019;s going bankrupt over two sips. When did you become such a crank?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Since you started pilfering Slurpee and pretending you can&#x2019;t operate the gas pump so I have to come out and fill your tank for you. Every time you pull in, I want to kick myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>I wrinkled my nose. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t want my hands smelling like gas. And you are particularly good at pumping gas, Willie,&#x201d; I added with a flattering smile.<br> <br>&#x201c;Practice makes perfect,&#x201d; he muttered.<br> <br>I padded barefoot through the aisles looking for Twizzlers and Cheez-Its, thinking that if Willie didn&#x2019;t like pumping my gas he really should get another job, when the front door chimed. I didn&#x2019;t even hear footsteps before a pair of warm, calloused hands slipped over my eyes from behind.<br> <br>&#x201c;Guess who?&#x201d;<br> <br>His familiar soapy smell seemed to freeze me. I prayed he couldn&#x2019;t feel my face heat up under his touch. For the longest moment, I couldn&#x2019;t find my voice. It seemed to shrink inside me, bouncing painfully down my throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;Give me a clue,&#x201d; I said, hoping I sounded bored. Or mildly annoyed. Anything but hurt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Short. Fat. Obnoxious overbite.&#x201d; His smooth, teasing voice after all these months. It sounded familiar and foreign at the same time. Feeling him so close made me dizzy from nerves. I was afraid I&#x2019;d start yelling at him, right here in the 7-Eleven. If I let him get too close, I was afraid I might not yell at him. And I wanted to yell&#x2014;I&#x2019;d spent eight months practicing what I&#x2019;d say and I was ready to let it out.<br> <br>&#x201c;In that case, I&#x2019;ll have to go with&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Calvin Versteeg.&#x201d; I sounded carelessly polite. I was sure of it. And I couldn&#x2019;t think of a bigger relief.<br> <br>Cal came around me and leaned an elbow on the aisle&#x2019;s endcap. He gave me a wolfish smile. He had nailed the whole devilishly charming thing years ago. I&#x2019;d been a sucker for it back then, but I was stronger now.<br> <br>Ignoring his handsome face, I gave him a bored once-over. By the looks of it, he&#x2019;d let his pillow style his hair this morning. It was longer than I remembered. On the hottest days of track practice, when sweat dripped off the tips, his hair had turned the color of tree bark. The memory made something inside me ache. I shoved aside my nostalgia and eyed Calvin with cool detachment. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;<br> <br>Without asking, he bent my Slurpee straw sideways and helped himself. He wiped his mouth on the back of his hand. &#x201c;Tell me about this camping trip.&#x201d;<br> <br>I yanked my Slurpee out of his reach. &#x201c;Backpacking trip.&#x201d; I felt it was important to make the distinction. Anyone could camp. Backpacking required skill and moxie.<br> <br>&#x201c;Got everything you need?&#x201d; he went on.<br> <br>&#x201c;And a few wants, too.&#x201d; I shrugged. &#x201c;Hey, a girl needs her lip gloss.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s be honest. Korbie will never let you leave the cabin. She&#x2019;s terrified of fresh air. And you can&#x2019;t say no to her.&#x201d; He tapped his head wisely. &#x201c;I know you girls.&#x201d;<br> <br>I gave him a look of indignation. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re backpacking for one full week. Our route is forty miles long.&#x201d; So maybe it was a teensy exaggeration. In fact, Korbie had agreed to no more than two miles of hiking per day, and had insisted we hike in circles around Idlewilde, in case we needed quick access to amenities or cable TV. While I&#x2019;d never truly expected to backpack the entire week, I had planned to leave Korbie and Bear at the cabin for a day and trek off on my own. I wanted to put my training to the test. Obviously now that Calvin was joining us, he was going to find out about our true plans soon enough, but at the moment my biggest priority was impressing him. I was sick of him forever insinuating that he had no reason to take me seriously. I could always deal with any flak he might give me later by insisting that I&#x2019;d wanted to backpack the whole week and Korbie was holding me back&#x2014;Calvin wouldn&#x2019;t find that excuse far-fetched.<br> <br>&#x201c;You do know that several of the hiking trails are still covered in snow, right? And the lodges haven&#x2019;t opened for the season, so people are sparse. Even the Jenny Lake Ranger Station is closed. Your safety is your own responsibility&#x2014;they don&#x2019;t guarantee rescue.&#x201d;<br> <br>I gazed at him with round eyes. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t say! I&#x2019;m not going into this completely in the dark, Calvin,&#x201d; I snapped. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got it covered. We&#x2019;ll be fine.&#x201d;<br> <br>He rubbed his mouth, hiding a smile, his thoughts perfectly clear.<br> <br>&#x201c;You really don&#x2019;t think I can do it,&#x201d; I said, trying not to sound stung.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just think the two of you will have more fun if you go to Lava Hot Springs. You can soak in the mineral pools.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been training for this trip all year,&#x201d; I argued. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know how hard I&#x2019;ve worked, because you haven&#x2019;t been around. You haven&#x2019;t seen me in eight months. I&#x2019;m not the same girl you left behind. You don&#x2019;t know me anymore.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Point made,&#x201d; he said, flipping up his palms to show it was an innocent suggestion. &#x201c;But why Idlewilde? There&#x2019;s nothing to do up there. You and Korbie will be bored after the first night.&#x201d;<br> <br>I didn&#x2019;t know why Calvin was so set on dissuading me. He loved Idlewilde. And he knew as well as I did that there was plenty to do there. Then it hit me. This wasn&#x2019;t about me or Idlewilde. He didn&#x2019;t want to have to tag along. He didn&#x2019;t want to spend time with me. If he got me to drop the trip, his dad wouldn&#x2019;t force him to join us, and he&#x2019;d get his spring break back.<br> <br>Digesting this painful realization, I cleared my throat. &#x201c;How much are your parents paying you to tag along?&#x201d;<br> <br>He made a big deal of looking me over in mock critical evaluation. &#x201c;Clearly not enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>So that&#x2019;s how we were going to play this. A little meaningless flirtation here, a little banter there. In my imagination, I took a black marker and drew a big X through Calvin&#x2019;s name.<br> <br>&#x201c;Just so we&#x2019;re clear, I argued against having you come. You and me together again? Talk about uncomfortable.&#x201d; It had sounded better in my head. Hanging between us now, the words sounded jealous and petty and mean&#x2014;exactly like an ex-girlfriend would sound. I didn&#x2019;t want him to know I was still hurting. Not when he was all smiles and winks.<br> <br>&#x201c;That so? Well, this chaperone just cut your curfew by an hour,&#x201d; he jested.<br> <br>I nodded beyond the store&#x2019;s plate-glass window toward the four-wheel-drive BMW X5 parked outside. &#x201c;Yours?&#x201d; I guessed. &#x201c;Yet another gift from your parents, or do you actually do more than chase girls at Stanford, suc...</p><h2>Thoughts for Young Men</h2><p>Thoughts for Young Men is a work by J. C. Ryle now brought to you in this new edition of the timeless classic.</p><p>There are four great temptations that plague most young men: sloth, lust, love of pleasure, and peer pressure. J.C. Ryle -- the last of the great Puritans -- tackles each of these subjects with a tenderness and tact which is unsurpassed. First written toward the end of the nineteenth century, it remains to this day the most relevant and helpful book on the subject in print. I was first introduced to Ryle about fifteen years ago, and he remains my favorite teacher on personal holiness.J. C. Ryle (1816-1900) was the first Anglican Bishop of Liverpool, and is widely regarded as having one of the most significant and impactful ministries of his generation. His works remain widely read today. He is affectionately referred to as that man of granite, with the heart of a child in a recent biography. We hope our publication of this small book has a part in producing a few more men of that description.</p><h2>The Singer&#39;s Musical Theatre Anthology - Volume 2: Tenor Book Only (Singer&#39;s Musical Theatre Anthology (Songbooks))</h2><p>(Vocal Collection). 42 songs, including: All Good Gifts * Alone at the Drive-In Movie * Anthem * The Apple Tree (Forbidden Fruit) * Asking for You * At the Grand Hotel * Beautiful Girls * A Bit of Earth * Boy for Sale * Bring Him Home * Close Every Door * Geraniums in the Winder * High Flying, Adored * I Believe in You * I Know About Love * I like You * I Met a Girl * I Only Want to Say (Gethsemane) * I Will Follow You * Jasper&#39;s Confession * Like a God * Love Can&#39;t Happen * Lucky in Love * Margot * Maybe I Should Change My Ways * Miracle of Miracles * The Music of the Night * Old Devil Moon * On This Night of a Thousand Stars * Once upon a Time Today * Serenade * She Loves Me * She Wasn&#39;t You * Sit down You&#39;re Rockin&#39; the Boat * Tango Tragique * This Is the Moment * Tonight at Eight * Where I Want to Be * Why God Why? * Willkommen * Winter&#39;s on the Wing * Young and Foolish.</p><p></p><h2>Endgame: A Journal of the Seventy-Ninth Year</h2><p><p><strong>"Sarton has been the lighthouse light for millions of women, and despite the dimming of that light, she remains [in this book] the Sarton who wrote <em>Journal of a Solitude</em>."&#x2015;<em>Library Journal</em></strong></p> "I had always imagined a philosophical journal of my seventy-ninth year, dealing with the joys and problems, the doors opening out from old age to unknown efforts and surprises. I looked forward to the year as a potent harvest," May Sarton writes. Assailed by debilitating illnesses, Sarton found herself instead using much of her energy battling for health. Yet, as this record shows, she did after all do what she had wanted to, as she persevered in work, friendships, and love of nature, discovering in the process new landscapes in the country of old age.</p><p>May Sarton (1912-1995) was an acclaimed poet, novelist, and memoirist.Sarton resumes the litany of woes she began in Recovering (1980) and continued in At Seventy (1984) and After the Stroke (1988). This new installment, like the earlier ones, is packed with tales of depression, dyspepsia, wearisome diets, and wobbly dentures, among other tribulations. In addition to these Job-like entries, Sarton includes in this yearlong journal comments on such familiar topics as her garden, the harshness of Maine winters, and her past lesbian love affairs; she settles some old literary scores as well (John Ciardi comes in for a bit of bashing here). Self-congratulation permeates the pages: References to Sarton's ``fans'' appear frequently, joined by such boasts as, ``I don't think there are many writers--serious writers--who make as much money as I do.'' If this journal was not so obviously intended for publication but was in fact merely a kind of personal diary, the inclusion of many of the details recorded would be far more explicable. As it is, even the most devoted of Sarton's admirers are unlikely to find the fact that the author ate ``mussels and delicious, chopped-up fresh spinach'' on March 11, 1991, of enormous interest. When she turns her gaze outward, though, Sarton is far more interesting. She draws a gracious if inconclusive portrait of Virginia Woolf, with whom she often had tea in the late 1930's, and she reminisces about Lord David Cecil in several anecdotes that celebrate his erudition and eccentricity. Overall, far too garrulous and far, far too querulous. (Fifty- one photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Their poetry was also a central inspiration for Dante and his Italian contemporaries, propagators of the modern vernacular lyric, and seven centuries later it was no less important to the modernist Ezra Pound. These poems, a source to which poetry has returned again and again in search of renewal, are subtle, startling, earthy, erotic, and supremely musical.<br><br>The poet Paul Blackburn studied and translated the troubadours for twenty years, and the result of that long commitment is <i>Proensa</i>, an anthology of thirty poets of the eleventh through thirteenth centuries, which has since established itself not only as a powerful and faithful work of translation but as a work of poetry in its own right. Blackburn&#x2019;s <i>Proensa</i>, George Economou writes, &#x201c;will take its place among Gavin Douglas&#x2019; <i>Aeneid</i>, Golding&#x2019;s <i>Metamorphoses</i>, the Homer of Chapman, Pope, and Lattimore, Waley&#x2019;s Japanese, and Pound&#x2019;s Chinese, Italian, and Old English.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Paul Blackburn</b> (1926&#x2013;1971) was born in St. Albans, Vermont, the son of the poet and children&#x2019;s book author Frances Frost. When he was fourteen he moved from Vermont to Greenwich Village, later spending a year at New York University before enlisting in the army. After his military service he transferred to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where he studied Old Proven�al and began a correspondence with Ezra Pound. Through Pound he became friends with Robert Creeley and was introduced to many in Creeley&#x2019;s circle. In 1954 Blackburn received a Fulbright to study Proven�al literature in the south of France and it was there he embarked on the project that would become <i>Proensa</i>. Back in New York, he continued to write and publish poetry while working various jobs, including printing-house clerk and encyclopedia-entry writer, and running a reading series that would become the legendary Poetry Project at St. Mark&#x2019;s in the Bowery. He was known for encouraging the work of the young poets who later rose to prominence as members of the New York School and the Beats. By the mid-1960s, Blackburn had become recognized enough to take on traditional teaching jobs, and in 1967 received a Guggenheim Fellowship, which allowed him to live in Europe and concentrate on his own work. In all he published thirteen books of poetry and five translations, including works by El Cid, Pablo Picasso, Federico Garc�a Lorca, and Julio Cort�zar.

Arranged thematically, it covers the highlights of Nibley&#39;s best thinking and writing on everything from the Creation, through ancient people, times, and documents, to modern-day prophets and righteous living today. Two features give great insight into the man and his life&#39;s work: a very personal life sketch about Hugh Nibley written by his grandson, and an introduction about Nibley&#39;s contribution to LDS literature and scholarship, his unique dynamic within the Church, and his abiding testimony. With highlights drawn from nearly 10,000 pages of the Collected Works of Hugh Nibley, The Essential Nibley shows how Nibley continues to give thinkers something to believe in and believers something to think about, even today.</p><p>Marvin R.

Carter chronicles the dramatic rise and fall of George Wallace, a populist who abandoned his ideals to become a national symbol of racism, and later begged for forgiveness. In <i>The Politics of Rage, </i>Carter argues persuasively that the four-time Alabama governor and four-time presidential candidate helped to establish the conservative political movement that put Ronald Reagan in the White House in 1980 and gave Newt Gingrich and the Republicans control of Congress in 1994. In this second edition, Carter updates Wallace&#x2019;s story with a look at the politician&#x2019;s death and the nation&#x2019;s reaction to it and gives a summary of his own sense of the legacy of &#x201c;the most important loser in twentieth-century American politics.&#x201d;</p><p>Dan T. Carter is Education Foundation Professor of History at the University of South Carolina and former president of the Southern Historical Association. He is the author of <i>Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South</i>, winner of the Bancroft Prize in American History; <i>From George Wallace to Newt Gingrich: Race in the Conservative Counterrevolution, 1963&#x2013;1994; </i>and <i>When the War Was Over: The Failure of Self-Reconstruction in the South</i>.Despite the title, this book is mainly an interpretive biography of former Alabama governor Wallace, with few revelations but more of a skeptical edge than Stephan Lesher's recent authorized bio, George Wallace: American Populist. (This book argues, contra Lesher, that Wallace did in fact vow not to be "out-niggered.") A history professor at Emory University, Carter (Scottsboro) has produced a detailed and readable account of Wallace?"the most influential loser in twentieth-century American politics"?as political animal, driven by ambition far more than by ideology, with a disarmingly folksy personal style. On the wrong side in so many civil rights-era clashes, from Bull Connor's brutality in Birmingham to the admitting of black students to the state university, Wallace nonetheless tapped the "Southernization" of suburban and ethnic white America, thereby fueling his two presidential bids. Though his crippling in a 1972 assassination attempt ended his political career, Wallace, as the author states in a coda, anticipated "the conservative groundswell that transformed American politics in the 1980s." <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Founding Faith: How Our Founding Fathers Forged a Radical New Approach to Religious Liberty</h2><p>The culture wars have distorted the dramatic story of how Americans came to worship freely. Many activists on the right maintain that the United States was founded as a &#x201c;Christian nation.&#x201d; Many on the left contend that the First Amendment was designed to boldly separate church and state. Neither of these claims is true, argues Beliefnet.com editor in chief Steven Waldman. With refreshing objectivity, Waldman narrates the real story of how our nation&#x2019;s Founders forged a new approach to religious liberty.<br><br><i>Founding Faith </i>vividly describes the religious development of five Founders. Benjamin Franklin melded the Puritan theology of his youth and the Enlightenment philosophy of his adulthood. John Adams&#x2019;s pungent views on religion stoked his revolutionary fervor and shaped his political strategy. George Washington came to view religious tolerance as a military necessity. Thomas Jefferson pursued a dramatic quest to &#x201c;rescue&#x201d; Jesus, in part by editing the Bible. Finally, it was James Madison who crafted an integrated vision of how to prevent tyranny while encouraging religious vibrancy.<br><br>The spiritual custody battle over the Founding Fathers and the role of religion in America continues today.

Less acknowledged today is a point well understood by the Founding Fathers: Nearly all of these experiments in state encouragement of religion failed.<br>Christopher Columbus believed the world would soon end. In the year 1652, to be exact, Christ would return and usher in a glorious new Kingdom&#x2014;if certain prophecies were fulfilled before then. Columbus&#x2019;s arrival in the New World in 1492 was one such event, he wrote later, a clear &#x201c;fulfillment of what Isaiah had prophesied.&#x201d; He was quite certain that God had guided him. &#x201c;With a hand that could be felt, the Lord opened my mind to the fact that it would be possible to sail from here to the Indies.&#x201d; Another precondition for Jesus&#x2019;s return was the conquest of Jerusalem, which was held by the Muslims. His voyages to the New World would help with that, too, providing a glorious model to inspire Christian warriors, and the gold to pay their way. Finally, his discovery of the new lands would enable Christians to fulfill another essential requirement, the spreading of the Good News to all corners of the world. &#x201c;The Gospel must now be proclaimed to so many lands in such a short time,&#x201d; Columbus explained to Queen Isabella and King Ferdinand.1<br><br>After encountering hospitable natives in the Caribbean, he had become quite optimistic that he would indeed be able to bring these generous but unsaved souls to God, plus get some cheap labor. &#x201c;If one asks for anything they have they never say no,&#x201d; he wrote.2 &#x201c;They should be good servants . . . and I believe they would easily be made Christians, for they appear to have no religion.&#x201d;3<br><br>Though he declared a desire to convert them &#x201c;by love and friendship rather than by force,&#x201d; the Europeans did not have a light touch with the natives. Those in the Caribbean who rejected or destroyed statues of Christian saints were burned at the stake. Slaughter and European-borne disease killed all but a few thousand Indians.4 But the Spaniards persisted and their missions eventually made their way to current-day Florida and Mexico.<br><br>While the Spaniards did not ultimately win control of the land that became the thirteen American colonies, fear of Catholic Spain&#x2019;s expansion helped prompt England to get serious about settling America in the early 1600s.5<br><br>Virginia&#x2019;s Lawes Divine<br><br>The twin goals of converting Indians and defeating Catholics provided a strong rallying cry for Virginia&#x2019;s settlers. Prospective settlers were instructed to bring &#x201c;no traitors, nor Papists that depend on the Great Whore.&#x201d;6 An Anglican promotional booklet argued that if the Spanish had so much luck pressing their corrupt religion, imagine how successful the English could be with their noble goals of saving &#x201c;those wretched people,&#x201d; drawing them from &#x201c;darkness to light, from falsehood to truth, from dumb idols to the living God, from the deep pit of hell to the highest heaven.&#x201d;7 King James&#x2019;s charter for Virginia in 1606 made it official: The mission was to promote Christianity to those living &#x201c;in darkness and miserable ignorance of the true knowledge and worship of God.&#x201d;8<br><br>The faiths of the settlers were tested even before they landed in Virginia. One-third of the immigrants on the Godspeed, the Discovery, and the Susan Constant in 1607 died en route. Once in America, their goal of converting Indians soon took a backseat to survival. In 1609 and 1610, the period known as &#x201c;the starving time,&#x201d; the colony almost perished. Settlers ate dogs, cats, rats, and one another in order to survive. One man was executed for killing his wife for food.9<br><br>To try to salvage the colony, the Virginia Company in May 1611 sent Lord Thomas de la Warr and Thomas Dale, who swiftly issued a new set of laws to bring order, in part through forced religiosity. The law&#x2019;s preamble declared that the job of the king is &#x201c;principal care of true Religion and reverence to God&#x201d;10 and that the settlers themselves were &#x201c;especial souldiers in this sacred cause.&#x201d; The new &#x201c;Lawes Divine, Morall and Martiall&#x201d; required worship twice each Sunday. Those who failed to do so would lose their daily allowance; a second infraction would draw a whipping, and the third offense would put them in the galleys at sea for six months. Settlers who failed to observe the Sabbath lost provisions for a week (first offense), received a whipping (second offense), or were executed (third offense). Women convicted of sexual misdeeds were required to wear white gowns, hold white wands, and &#x201c;stand on chairs or stools during public worship.&#x201d;11 Blasphemy&#x2014;the use of &#x201c;unlawful oaths&#x201d; and &#x201c;taking the name of God in vain&#x201d;&#x2014;was a serious crime, sometimes punishable by having a hot iron plunged through the tongue, and sometimes by execution.12 Eight settlers were put to death in Jamestown for violations of Dale&#x2019;s laws. Though alien to us, the idea behind forced worship was practical: Pervasive worship would secure God&#x2019;s favor and give settlers the strength and moral wherewithal to cope with the crushing burdens of disease, Indian attacks, and internal squabbling.<br><br>As in England, clergy were to be supported by taxes and public funds, or, to be more precise, ten pounds of tobacco and a bushel of corn per settler. A special patch of farmland, a glebe, was also set aside for the parson.13 Despite these provisions, there was a severe shortage of clergy. By 1662, there were only ten ministers serving forty-five different parishes.14 Since there was no ecclesiastic church structure to monitor religious matters and manage clergy, the state accepted that role, even disciplining clergy who hadn&#x2019;t preached at least one sermon each Sunday.15<br><br>The settlers did survive, in part because of their strong faith. This alone prompted wonder. John Rolfe, an early Jamestown resident credited with the introduction of tobacco, wrote that the settlers were &#x201c;chosen by the finger of God.&#x201d;16<br><br>In surviving, they prevented encroachment from French and Spanish Catholics who settled west and south of Virginia. At that moment in history, the Catholic Church was viewed in England not as a competing form of Christianity but as a fraudulent faith. It was called &#x201c;the Whore&#x201d; because it had prostituted itself by selling indulgences (the promise that for a fee, the church would make sure that the soul of a loved one wouldn&#x2019;t be stuck in purgatory). Protestants believed Catholics should be called papists, not Christians, because they had substituted worship of the pope for devotion to Christ. And only the Antichrist, it was thought, would use the trappings of faith to so distort the message of Jesus. Not surprisingly, the Virginia government attempted to squelch Catholicism within the colony. In 1640, it prohibited Catholics from holding public office unless they &#x201c;had taken the oath of allegiance and supremacy&#x201d; to the Church of England. It decreed that any &#x201c;popish priests&#x2019;&#x2019; who arrived in Virginia &#x201c;should be deported forthwith.&#x201d;17<br><br>The settlers&#x2019; other religious goal&#x2014;that of pulling the Indians from the deep pit of hell&#x2014;proved harder to meet. Pocahontas&#x2019;s conversion to Christianity was much celebrated and, indeed, is depicted in a painting in the US Capitol to this day. But mostly the settlers just viewed the Indians as untamable savages, and vice versa.18 Moreover, Virginia certainly didn&#x2019;t limit itself to punishing just Catholics and Indians. In 1660, it forbade ship captains from importing Quakers;19 Puritan clergy were banished; and Jews were kept out entirely for two generations.20<br><br>As the economy developed and the population grew, the Church of En- gland became more powerful throughout Virginia. By 1740s, the church had become a place of social and spiritual nourishment for the gentlemen farmers who came to run the colony. Though it became more genteel and less coercive, Anglicanism remained the legally established, official religion of the colony. Taxpayers financed the salaries of the Anglican ministers in their area, as well as the construction of new Anglican churches. During some of this time, other religious bodies were simply not allowed to erect churches at all. Up through the 1740s, it was clear in Virginia that there was one church, one spiritual style, one faith&#x2014;not just by custom but by law.<br><br>The Holy Commonwealth of Massachusetts<br><br>While religion was a factor in Jamestown, it was the impetus for Pilgrims who landed in Plymouth and the Puritans who settled in Massachusetts Bay. Again, the motivation was not promotion of Christianity in general but Protestantism specifically. Puritans believed that despite Henry VIII&#x2019;s split with Rome, the Church of England had retained too many vestiges of the Catholic Church. &#x201c;Kneeling at the Sacrament, bowing to the Altar and to the name of Jesus, Popish holy days, Holiness of places, Organs and Cathedral Musick, The Books of Common prayer, or church Government by Bishops . . . They are nothing else but reliques of Popery, and remnants of Baal,&#x201d; sniffed one prominent Puritan.21 They viewed the Anglican ministers as ungodly and incompetent. In a petition to Parliament, one Puritan called the clergy &#x201c;Dumme Dogs . . . Destroying Drones, or rather Caterpillars of the Word.&#x201d;22 Worst of all, the Church of England seemed to let in as a congregant any damned sinner who requested entry.<br><br>King James found the Puritans annoying. While passing through Lancashire one day in 1618, he noticed that the Puritans had even prohibited sports and recreation. He explicitly prevented them from banning &#x201c;may-games, Whitsun-ales, Morris-dances, and the setting up of Maypoles&#x201d;&#x2014;all activities that Puritans regarded as pagan.23 Though we tend to think of those who settled in New England as fleeing severe religious persecution, it might be more precise to say most were avoiding the harassment of a government that wanted the Puritans to be more liberal. Frustrated by the relentless protests of the Puritans about the church, King James declared, &#x201c;I shall make them conform themselves, or I will harry them out of the land, or else do worse.&#x201d;24<br><br>The Pilgrims were Puritans who had become &#x201c;Separatists&#x201d; because they believed that the Church of England was so corruptly entangled with Catholicism that nothing short of a clean break would suffice. They had left England and sought religious refuge in Holland. Their sense of mission was biblical: William Bradford, in his journal from Plymouth Plantation, compared these settlers to those cast out of Israel. &#x201c;Our fathers were Englishmen which came over this great ocean, and were ready to perish in this wilderness; but they cried unto the Lord, and he heard their voice, and looked on their adversity.&#x201d;25 Sailing aboard the Mayflower in 1620, the Pilgrims wrote the Mayflower Compact, committing themselves to &#x201c;ye glory of God, and advancement of ye Christian faith.&#x201d;<br><br>Though the Pilgrims landed the starring roles in future Thanksgiving celebrations, it was the Puritans who thrived economically, took over Massachusetts, profoundly influenced American religious history. (One historian estimated that in all thirteen colonies, Puritanism &#x201c;provided the moral and religious background of fully 75% of the people who declared their independence in 1776.&#x201d;)26 In 1628, the &#x201c;great migration&#x201d; of Puritans from England began. They came for &#x201c;liberty,&#x201d; said the Massachusetts minister John Cotton&#x2014;the freedom to practice their religion precisely&#x2014;&#x201c;not of some ordinances of God, but of all, and in all purity.&#x201d;27 It was with tongue not in cheek that Richard Mather explained his motives for immigrating: the opportunity &#x201c;to censure those who ought to be censured.&#x201d;28<br><br>In spring 1630, John Winthrop, an influential Puritan, boarded the Arbella and headed toward the New Israel. On board, he gave what would become one of the most famous sermons in American history. They were &#x201c;God&#x2019;s chosen people,&#x201d; required by covenant to lead exemplary Christian lives. &#x201c;We shall be as a City upon a Hill,&#x201d; he declared. &#x201c;The eyes of all people are upon us.&#x201d; This passage has been used by many a politician since, evoking the idea that America would become a model of freedom for the world. But the rest of the sermon bore a darker message. If they didn&#x2019;t succeed in providing a Christian model, God would show his wrath&#x2014;&#x201c;we shall be made a story and a by-word through the world.&#x201d;29<br><br>The Puritans left us many ennobling legacies. They set up Congregational churches that stressed simplicity, local control, and a direct connection to God. Because reading the Bible was so central, they established a remarkable system of schools and pressed for widespread literacy. They outlawed usury and promoted the dignity of work, even to the point of endorsing trade guilds. But this book, by necessity, will focus on how they mixed church and state, and how they used power.<br><br>Like the Anglicans who settled in Virginia, the Puritans in Massachusetts viewed church and state as fully entwined&#x2014;a &#x201c;Holy Commonwealth.&#x201d; &#x201c;Theocracy, or to make the Lord God our governor, is the best form of government in a Christian commonwealth,&#x201d; wrote John Cotton. If it seems shocking to read one of our forefathers so boldly employ a word today associated with Islamic fundamentalists, we ought to remember that it was a typical approach at the time. Since Constantine made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, Western Christian leaders had believed that, thanks to Adam&#x2019;s bite of the apple, man was so inherently depraved, a strong one&#x2013;two punch of church and state working together would be required to tame his evil impulses.<br><br>The Puritans believed that civil authorities, bound by the same Bible as they, could be responsible for creating a godly society.30 This wasn&#x2019;t to be state manipulating church but rather church shaping state. According to Puritan theology, drawn from French theologian John Calvin, they had an obligation to create a kingdom of God on earth&#x2014;a society and a church of mostly &#x201c;visible saints&#x201d; that would make the worldly kingdom resemble heaven as much as possible. This church was to comprise a limited number of Christians selected by God to receive saving grace.31<br><br>Figuring out who was favored by God was no easy task. It helped if you were well behaved and prosperous, but that was no guarantee. A candidate for membership in a church would present him- or herself before the elders for examination. He would have to demonstrate facility with scriptures and provide a chronicle of how &#x201c;God&#x2019;s saving Grace came to him.&#x201d; The mission was not to save sinners but to eject them, protecting the saints from corruption. Thomas Shepard, the pastor of the church in Cambridge, Massachusetts, explained that &#x201c;if we could be so Eagle-eyed, as to discern them now that are hypocrites, we should exclude them now.&#x201d; Why? Because &#x201c;one man or woman secretly vile, which the church hath not used all means to discover, may defile a whole church.&#x201d;32<br><br>The church was composed of the saved, and the state would be governed by members of the church. Only full members of the Congregational churches could vote in civil elections. One Puritan named Robert Child suggested that the limitations on the franchise and church membership be abolished. The Massachusetts General Court rejected his request, and had him arrested for good measure.33 Of course, Catholics were not allowed. (Since the Puritans tried to embody the compassion of Jesus, they did allow that any &#x201c;Jesuits&#x201d; who had ended up in their midst due to a shipwreck need not be killed.)34 In 1644, the Massachusetts General Court banned Baptists, too.35 Increase Mather, a Boston Puritan leader, later declared that &#x201c;the Toleration of all Religions and Perswasions, is the way to have no Religion at a...</p><h2>Where Today Meets Tomorrow: Eero Saarinen and the General Motors Technical Center (icon of midcentury architecture by Eero Saarinen)</h2><p>Long before Microsoft or Apple occupied their legendary corporate campuses, there was the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Michigan.

Across the leaps and swerves of this collection, the fevered mind tries to slow&#x2015;or at least measure&#x2015;time with quiet bravura: by counting a lover&#x2019;s breaths; by remembering a father&#x2019;s space-age watch; by envisioning the apocalyptic future while bedding down on a hard, cold floor, head resting on a dictionary. <i>Human Hours </i>pulses with the absurd, with humor that accompanies the precariousness of the human condition.</p></p><p><b>Catherine Barnett</b> is the author of <i>Into Perfect Spheres Such Holes Are Pierced </i>and <i>The Game of Boxes</i>.

Petersen to regional representatives in 1969.</p><p>In that spirit, historian&nbsp;Devery S. Anderson&nbsp;has brought together a comprehensive collection of official documents on temple ceremonies, limited only by what would be inappropriate to discuss publicly. The documents include rulings by the First Presidency on changes to the ceremonies, letters to temple and stake presidents and bishops reminding them of temple policies, minutes of Quorum of the Twelve meetings, excerpts from sermons and Church publications, and commentary by apostles and temple presidents in diaries, letters, oral histories, and temple scrapbooks.</p><p>Yes, the temple ceremonies have changed since their inception in Nauvoo in the 1840s. The liturgy was originally conveyed as a memorized, oral tradition, then in 1877 the leadership committed it to writing to guarantee consistency among several temples and facilitate changes they wanted to make at that time. This was repeated in 1922 when George F. Richards and a committee of apostles was charged with reviewing and rewriting the ceremonies&#x2014;again in the 1950s when the dramatic presentation was replaced with a motion picture and the script was shortened. One comes away from these documents with a better understanding of what constitutes the essence of the temple and what, by contrast, is malleable: staging, costumes, wording of the dramatic portions, and practical details such as whether marriage proxies should kiss across the altar.</p></p><p><p><i><b>from the jacket flap:</b><br></i>Originally, in the Nauvoo temple and Utah&#x2019;s Endowment House, people dressed for the temple in a long white nightshirt or nightgown that extended below the knee. At a veil representing heaven, the participant&#x2019;s underclothing was marked, this being the crowning act of the ceremony. There was a logic to this sequence in that one promised to live a moral life and then received the marks to remind him or her of the promises made, versus the sequence today whereby an initiate puts on pre-marked&nbsp; underclothes at the beginning of the endowment ceremony in a washing room.</p><p>In a related departure, the nightshirt used to be marked along with the underwear as a nod to modesty. Brigham Young gave instructions on this in 1869 when he &#x201c;took the scissors &amp; soon made the marks,&#x201d; saying that even if the &#x201c;shirt was colored[,] mark it&#x2014;[I]f [there is] flannel or buckskin between [the] shirt &amp; garment[,] that also should be marked.&#x201d;</p><p>Twenty-five years later, a new First Presidency decided that whereas &#x201c;it has been the practice to mark the shirt, ... we think this unnecessary as it is not strictly a part of the Temple clothing. The marking of the garment should be done in the washing room and not at the veil; and the greatest care should be taken to see that no person is permitted to leave that room wearing an unmarked garment.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It is the mind of the First Presidency,&#x201d; Church leaders later wrote to the St. George temple president, &#x201c;that you adopt as soon as it can be done conveniently the practice of brethren wearing white pants while doing Temple work. This change would necessarily do away with the long white shirt usually worn by them, and admit of their wearing the regular white shirt, with collar and white tie if they choose to do so.&#x201d;</p><p>In time, the garment was standardized as a one-piece &#x201c;union suit,&#x201d; although this was not the original design. &#x201c;The garment is [now] like the ordinary union suit,&#x201d; Apostle John A. Widtsoe said in 1934, and &#x201c;much better than the two-piece suits our grandfathers and grandmothers grew up with.&#x201d; When two-piece garments were later re-introduced, the change was met with some resistance, similar to the reaction in 1923 when the garments were shortened to two inches above the ankles and wrists.</p><p>By 1937, one could purchase unmarked undergarments at ZCMI , and in the temple they were tailored, more or less, according to guidelines issued by Elder George F. Richards that year: &#x201c;When marking the garments, place the garment on the person unmarked, place pins in the marked space, take the garments off[,] and proceed to cut the marks.&#x201d; Some aspects of the ceremony have been altered, the foregoing being only one example of many such refinements. It is instructive to know what has changed and what has not and why, as well as what the process has been. These are issues that are both interesting theologically and of significance on a personal level for those who have been to the temple.</p><b>Devery Scott Anderson is</b>&nbsp;co-editor of&nbsp;Joseph Smith&#x2019;s Quorum of the Anointed, 1842-1845&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Nauvoo Endowment Companies, 1845-1846,&nbsp;which together won the Mormon History Association&#x2019;s 2006 Best Documentary Book Award.

They live in Ottawa.Grade 7-12-- A compelling fantasy that combines elements of Native American and Celtic mythology to create a fluid and unexpected otherworld, open to all with the ability to enter and traverse it. Teenaged cousins Nina and Ashley have shared a bedroom since Ash's mother's death three years earlier. Ash is often sullen, uncooperative, and in trouble, and the two are usually at odds. Then a series of disturbing nightmares in which Nina finds herself awkwardly inhabiting the bodies of various animals leaves her shaken and convinced that Ash is somehow responsible. What Nina doesn't know is that Ash has stumbled into the dreaming place--the spirit world--and may be the only one who can rescue her from the hungry manitou spirit who is causing her visions. Surprising combinations of formal and informal language from both spirit and human characters help to link the worlds, making the spirit world more accessible while readers' own becomes more mysterious. The satisfying conclusion hints at more otherworldly adventures to come. While Nina is a rather bland character, Ash and her colorful friends and adversaries, and icons such as the strange tarot cards that foretell her journey and the pomegranate that is pivotal in her quest, come alive through the text. Froud's effective illustrations depict the characters Ash meets as well as the cards themselves, and reinforce the mood of the tale. --Susan L.

Exploring the violence racism visits upon peopleOCOs lives, KennedyOCOs plays express poetic alienation, transcending the particulars of character and plot through ritualistic repetition and radical structural experimentation. Frequently produced, read, and taught, they continue to hold a significant place among the most exciting dramas of the past fifty years. <br>This first comprehensive collection of her most important works traces the development of KennedyOCOs unique theatrical oeuvre from her Obie-winning Funnyhouse of a Negro (1964) through significant later works such as A Movie Star Has to Star in Black and White (1976), Ohio State Murders (1992), and June and Jean in Concert, for which she won an Obie in 1996. The entire contents of KennedyOCOs groundbreaking collections In One Act and The Alexander Plays are included, as is her earliest work Because of the King of France and the play An Evening with Dead Essex (1972). More recent prose writings Secret Paragraphs about My Brother, A Letter to Flowers, and Sisters Etta and Ella are fascinating refractions of the themes and motifs of her dramatic works, even while they explore new material on teaching and writing. An introduction by Werner Sollors provides a valuable overview of KennedyOCOs career and the trajectory of her literary development. <br>Adrienne Kennedy (b. 1931) is a three-time Obie-award winning playwright whose works have been widely performed and anthologized. Among her many honors are the American Academy of Arts and Letters award and the Guggenheim fellowship. In 1995-6, the Signature Theatre Company dedicated its entire season to presenting her work. She has been commissioned to write works for the Public Theater, Jerome Robbins, the Royal Court Theatre, the Mark Taper Forum, and Juilliard, and she has been a visiting professor at Yale, Princeton, Brown, the University of California at Berkeley, and Harvard. She lives in New York City. <br>"</p><p>It is a pleasure to have so much of Kennedy's output in a single volume, the first major collection of her work. Kennedy won Obie awards for her plays Funnyhouse of a Negro, June and Jean in Concert (both included here), and Sleep Deprivation Chamber (written with her son Adam). Her texts are often fragmentary, nonlinear, and experimental; they are also highly feminist and often deal with the painful topic of racism from the viewpoint of an African American woman who came of age in the 1950s and 1960s. Kennedy was inspired by many things: visits to family in Georgia, Giotto's frescoes, fairy tales, extensive travel to Europe and Africa, and Hollywood films. During a long stay in Africa and Europe, she wrote an experimental short story, "Because of the King of France," published under a pen name in the journal Black Orpheus and reprinted in this volume. Werner Sollors's (Beyond Ethnicity) introduction helpfully puts Kennedy's work into an autobiographical and theatrical context, but the plays, short stories, and other writings are the most valuable aspect of this volume. Of particular importance is a group of previously unpublished prose pieces. Recommended to academic libraries and libraries with theater collections. Susan L.

Brown instead connects the shift from sentiment to action to changing views of empire and nation in Britain at the time, particularly the anxieties and dislocations spurred by the American Revolution. The debate over the political rights of the North American colonies pushed slavery to the fore, Brown argues, giving antislavery organizing the moral legitimacy in Britain it had never had before. The first emancipation schemes were dependent on efforts to strengthen the role of the imperial state in an era of weakening overseas authority. By looking at the initial public contest over slavery, Brown connects disparate strands of the British Atlantic world and brings into focus shifting developments in British identity, attitudes toward Africa, definitions of imperial mission, the rise of Anglican evangelicalism, and Quaker activism. Demonstrating how challenges to the slave system could serve as a mark of virtue rather than evidence of eccentricity, Brown shows that the abolitionist movement derived its power from a profound yearning for moral worth in the aftermath of defeat and American independence. Thus abolitionism proved to be a cause for the abolitionists themselves as much as for enslaved Africans.</p><p>"A fascinating study of a crucial episode in Atlantic history. . . .

But in a world where former rulers have become new foes, an alien threat to humanity may turn old adversaries into uncertain allies.<br>&nbsp;<br>President Gwen Iceni believes Midway is their only defense against the enigmas. Syndicate training taught her self-preservation in a crisis, yet she&#x2019;s determined to fight for the star system&#x2019;s fate...even if it means joining forces with another former Syndicate CEO&#x2014;and an officer of the hated Alliance.<br>&nbsp;<br>Despite General Artur Drakon&#x2019;s misgivings, he partnered with Iceni to overthrow Syndic forces. Now, with an enigma fleet menacing their hard-earned independence, he can ill afford to trust her&#x2014;or lose her support. But in the back of his mind, there are three words that describe someone who confides in a Syndicate CEO: <i>Stupid. Betrayed. Dead.</i></p><p><b>&#x201c;Jack Campbell&#x201d;</b> is the pen name of John G. Hemry, a retired naval officer who graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis before serving with the surface fleet and in a variety of other assignments. He is the <i>New York Times </i>bestselling author of The Lost Fleet series as well as the Stark&#x2019;s War series and the Paul Sinclair series. His short fiction appears frequently in <i>Analog</i> magazine. The Lost Stars series includes <i>Tarnished Knight </i>and <i>Imperfect Sword</i>.<b>Chapter One</b><br><br>THIS day hadn&#x2019;t started out badly, but now it looked very much as if one of the next few days would end with him dead. The most important questions General Artur Drakon still faced were exactly who would pull the trigger, exactly when it would happen, and how many other people would die along with him.&#x201c;<br><br>Two hundred twenty-two alien warships,&#x201d; Colonel Bran Malin reported with an impressive show of calm. Above and behind Malin ,the planetary command center&#x2019;s main display portrayed the entire Midway Star System and every ship within it in depressingly accurate detail. The warships of the alien enigma race were four and a half light-hours distant, having arrived at the jump point from the star Pele, which had been occupied by the aliens decades ago. &#x201c;We face overwhelming odds even if the Syndicate flotilla commanded by CEO Boyens joins with our forces.<br><br>&#x201d;<i>Our forces</i>. Drakon focused on the depictions of those for a moment, trying not to let his gloom show outwardly. Many workers were at their control consoles in the command center, all of them supposedly focused on their work, but all of them certainly watching him for the first sign of panic or even uncertainty.<br><br>Near this planet orbited the main body of the grandly named &#x201c;Midway Flotilla.&#x201d; Two heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, and twelve small Hunter-Killers. A pitiful force by the standards of the recent war between the Syndicate Worlds and the Alliance, but Syndicate losses had been so heavy in the last part of the war that this now ranked as a decent-sized flotilla within the territory where the authority of the Syndicate Worlds once ran unchallenged. About a light-hour distant, at the space dock orbiting a gas-giant planet, were a battleship and two more heavy cruisers. That looked more impressive, except for the fact that the recently constructed and recently named battleship <i>Midway</i> (recently stolen from a Syndicate-controlled dockyard at the star Kane, where it was being outfitted) did not yet have any working weapons.<br><br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not really <i>our</i> forces,&#x201d; Drakon said to Malin. &#x201c;The Kommodor in charge of the Midway Flotilla answers to President Iceni.&#x201d; She might call herself President now, but a few months ago Gwen Iceni had been a Syndicate CEO, just as Drakon had also once been. &#x201c;We banded together out of necessity to overthrow the authority of the Syndicate Worlds in this star system before the Syndicate could order our deaths, but you know how little we can afford to trust each other.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;President Iceni has not double-crossed you,&#x201d; Colonel Malin pointed out.&#x201c;<br><br>Yet. You know the words used in the Syndicate for CEOs who trust other CEOs. Stupid. Betrayed. Dead. Are you sure she hasn&#x2019;t tried to call Boyens and make a deal for herself?&#x201d; The Syndicate flotilla controlled by CEO Boyens consisted of a battleship, six heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, and ten HuKs. The Midway Flotilla had faced a desperate and probably hopeless fight against that force until the aliens called enigmas had shown up in overwhelming numbers to menace all humans in this star system.<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely certain, General. If you and President Iceni can trust each other, neither of you is likely to trust CEO Boyens to honor any deal he agreed to,&#x201d; Malin insisted. &#x201c;Even if Boyens wanted to play it straight, the snakes with his flotilla would demand that both you and Iceni die for your leadership roles in the revolt.<br><br>&#x201d;He could see the humor in that. &#x201c;I have the Syndicate Internal Security Service to thank for being certain that Iceni won&#x2019;t betray me to Boyens. That&#x2019;s the first time the snakes ever made me feel more secure.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, sir. But Boyens and his flotilla are a relatively minor problem at the moment. It is possible that he will agree to a proposal from you and President Iceni that he join forces with us against the enigmas.&#x201d;<br><br>Drakon shook his head. &#x201c;No, he won&#x2019;t. There&#x2019;s no percentage for Boyens in joining with us. He came here under Syndicate orders to defeat us and retake this star system, but now that the enigmas have shown up, every human at Midway is very likely doomed. Why should he die fighting a hopeless battle trying to save us?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; President Gwen Iceni answered as she walked up to Drakon, her every movement and tone of voice carefully controlled to portray a calm confidence that in a lesser person would have seemed ridiculous under these circumstances.<br><br>But, Drakon admitted to himself, Iceni could carry it off .<br><br>&#x201c;CEO Boyens,&#x201d; Iceni continued, &#x201c;is a practical man. There is no hope for us there,&#x201d; she added in a matter-of-fact way at odds with her words.<br><br>Drakon turned to Iceni. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve talked to the enigmas in the past. Is there any chance of a deal with them?&#x201d;<br><br>Iceni shook her head, her own expression calculating rather than fearful. Like Drakon, she knew that it was critically important for leaders not to show fear. A display of fear communicated weakness, and in the Syndicate system, weak CEOs became targets for those under them. Workers might panic if they saw their leaders openly afraid, or senior subordinates might decide an assassination-driven change in leaders might improve their own chances of survival, or believing the situation to be hopeless, the workers themselves might rise up and wreak last-ditch revenge on their leaders for past suffering.<br><br>&#x201c;The enigmas,&#x201d; Iceni continued, &#x201c;don&#x2019;t talk with us, they talk <i>to</i> us. When they deign to speak to us, they make demands and never respond to anything except agreement. I would be very surprised if they even bother communicating with us this time before they kill us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is this Black Jack&#x2019;s fault? Did he stir up the enigmas like we feared?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s possible.&#x201d; Her gaze went to the main display floating in the middle of the command center. &#x201c;Black Jack did promise to defend this star system against the enigmas.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see Black Jack&#x2019;s fleet,&#x201d; Drakon replied, his voice harsh, &#x201c;and I don&#x2019;t think the enigmas will be impressed by our telling them that we&#x2019;ve got that promise. Black Jack took the Alliance fleet into enigma territory, raised hell, very likely got blown to pieces, and now the enigmas are here to finish the job they wanted to do several months ago.&#x201d;<br><br>He didn&#x2019;t bother adding that, unlike that previous time, on this occasion the Alliance fleet under the command of the legendary Admiral John &#x201c;Black Jack&#x201d; Geary wasn&#x2019;t here to stop the enigmas. Until about a year ago, Geary had been thought dead for the last century, but he had reappeared to wreak havoc on the forces of the Syndicate Worlds and compel an end to the war everyone had resigned them-selves to believing to be unending. In the process, Geary had also shattered any claim by the Syndicate government to be representing a superior system and annihilated the great majority of the Syndicate warships that had been a major factor in ensuring Syndicate control of the planets under their rule.<br><br>But Geary had taken his fleet into enigma territory to try to learn more about the first alien intelligent race encountered by humanity. No Syndicate incursion into enigma space had ever returned.<br><br>&#x201c;The situation . . .&#x201d; Iceni paused before continuing in a thoughtful tone &#x201c;is difficult.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very difficult,&#x201d; Drakon agreed, surprised that he could let a trace of dry humor into his own voice at such a time. <i>Damn, she&#x2019;s impressive</i>. &#x201c;All of my ground forces in this star system are coming to full combat status, but none of them stand a chance against the enigmas if the aliens bombard us from orbit.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All of my mobile forces are also being brought to full combat alert,&#x201d; Iceni informed him. &#x201c;Those at the gas giant saw the arrival of the enigmas an hour before we did, and we just received the status update from them. They are as ready as they can be.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Too bad we didn&#x2019;t have time to get that battleship operational.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; Iceni said. &#x201c;It would have been useful,&#x201d; she added in a masterpiece of understatement. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s only one thing left to do besides trying to bluff the enigmas, and that is trying to arrange a truce with the Syndicate force.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You just agreed with me that Boyens wouldn&#x2019;t fight alongside us,&#x201d; Drakon said bluntly.<br><br>&#x201c;I said truce, not merger. Our very slim chance of bluffing the enigmas into leaving will be improved slightly if Boyens appears to be part of the defensive force instead of another invader. And Boyens has reason to assist us in that bluff. His masters on Prime want this star system back. If the enigmas take it, or destroy it, Boyens will not have succeeded in his mission.&#x201d; One side of her mouth curved in a humorless half smile. &#x201c;As you and I both know from painful experience, the Syndicate government won&#x2019;t let the fact that it is impossible for Boyens to succeed in the face of the enigmas influence their decision that he failed, nor will it mitigate the punishment they mete out for that failure.&#x201d;<br><br>Colonel Rho Morgan had arrived while Iceni and Drakon spoke, and now saluted Drakon. Morgan&#x2019;s eyes glinted with a strange light, as if the prospect of a desperate fight excited her. &#x201c;Colonels Rogero, Gaiene, and Kai report their brigades are ready for action and are stiffening the locals.&#x201d;<br><br>Drakon nodded, his mouth twisting in annoyance. &#x201c;The locals are nervous, I suppose.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not like there&#x2019;s anywhere to run,&#x201d; Morgan said. She stepped close to Drakon, so close they almost touched. Her voice came out whisper-soft yet still clear despite the background noise in the command center. &#x201c;Nowhere for <i>them</i>to run. I have a special forces shuttle standing by. Full stealth configuration. We can lift without being spot-ted and be boarding one of the heavy cruisers in orbit within half an hour while decoy comms make everyone think you&#x2019;re in the ground forces headquarters.&#x201d;<br><br>He frowned, thrown off momentarily by her nearness and the memories Morgan&#x2019;s body aroused of a drunken night he wished had never happened. But it only took a moment to shake that and focus on her words. &#x201c;Leave the rest?&#x201d; he asked in the same quiet tones. A glance at the readouts on his wrist confirmed what he had suspected, that Morgan had personal jammers active that were blocking anyone else, even those nearby, from hearing what they were saying.<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry about leaving Gaiene and Kai,&#x201d; Morgan said in tones that held no trace of actual regret. &#x201c;But we can&#x2019;t take anyone else without tipping off what we&#x2019;re doing.&#x201d;<br><br>She hadn&#x2019;t mentioned Rogero or Malin, of course, neither of whom ranked high in Morgan&#x2019;s opinion. Drakon eyed her, knowing the rest of Morgan&#x2019;s plan without its having to be spelled out. He had, after all, made his own way up the ranks of the Syndicate hierarchy and learned the lessons that had to be picked up along the way. He and Morgan would hijack the heavy cruiser and head for a jump point, leaving everyone else here to fight against impossible odds. With that heavy cruiser&#x2019;s firepower, they might be able to establish control of some other, weaker, star system.<br><br>And everyone else at Midway would die, or whatever the fate was of those the enigmas captured. No one had ever learned what happened to humans who had fallen into the hands of the aliens.<br><br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Drakon said, his eyes returning to the situation display and the enemy forces arrayed there.<br><br>Morgan sighed with exasperation. &#x201c;All right. We can take Malin, too.&#x201d;<br><br>She probably thought that was a major concession given the level of mutual hatred between Malin and Morgan. But Drakon shook his head. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s not the point.&#x201d; How to explain it in a way that Morgan would accept, when even he didn&#x2019;t fully understand his own reluctance to do what Syndicate CEOs were taught to do in a crisis? &#x201c;I know the rule in a situation like this is to throw as many subordinates to the wolves as necessary. But I don&#x2019;t abandon people. You know that. That&#x2019;s how I ended up exiled to Midway.&#x201d; <i>And I guess that may be why I die here</i>.<br><br>Morgan leaned a little closer, her face almost touching his now, eyes blazing. &#x201c;It is important that you and I survive. We can set up business elsewhere and come back here someday with enough fi re-power to retake this star system and avenge&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not interested in avenging people I left to their fates.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t get to be a Syndicate CEO by making looking out for other people your first priority, General. We <i>both</i> know that.&#x201d;<br><br>Drakon shook his head stubbornly. &#x201c;I also know that if I leave here first, before President Iceni does, I&#x2019;ll look weaker than her. I&#x2019;ll also leave her in control of this planet and this star system.&#x201d; That was the sort of logic even Morgan could accept.<br><br>Morgan paused, her eyes going to Iceni. &#x201c;Maybe you won&#x2019;t leave first. Maybe she&#x2019;s halfway out the door.&#x201d;<br><br>Drakon glanced that way, seeing Iceni locked in close conversation with her personal assistant/bodyguard/assassin Mehmet Togo. Both Iceni and Togo had moved a few steps away. Drakon didn&#x2019;t need a scanner to be certain that their conversation was also being protected by personal jammers.<br><br>&#x201c;Iceni is planning her own escape,&#x201d; Morgan whispered. &#x201c;Watch. She&#x2019;ll bolt out of here with some lame excuse and head for a shuttle. I&#x2019;ve got snipers posted. We can nail her before she reaches the launch area.&#x201d;<br><br>Drakon frowned though he kept facing toward the display and not Iceni.&#x201c;<i>No</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>The force of that reply earned him a searching glance from Morgan. &#x201c;Why not? Is there some . . . personal reason?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; Drakon snapped back at her. He had gotten to know Iceni a lot better, had been able to learn more about the person behind the once-CEO and now-President, and he had found himself both having more (probably irrational) faith in her and enjoying their meetings. But none of those things were influencing him now. He was certain of that. &#x201c;We need Iceni. If we get through this somehow, we need her control of the warships.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Once the enigmas are done here, there won&#x2019;t be any warships,&#x201d; Morgan pointed out. &#x201c;Except theirs.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Stand down the snipers immediately. I don&#x2019;t want any accidents.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You need to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I need to have my orders obeyed, Colonel Morgan!&#x201d;<br><br>That might have been too loud for even the personal jammers to completely mask. No one actually looked toward Drakon and Morgan, because everyone in this command center knew better than to appear as if they were aware of any arguments among superiors, but he could sense a stiffening among those nearest, as if they were trying very hard to overcome the natural impulse to glance at the sound of rising voices.<br><br>Colonel Malin, normally very sensitive to Drakon&#x2019;s moods, now seemed totally absorbed in his own work. As much as he disliked Morgan, he also knew better than to let Drakon see him taking any interest or pleasure in her being chewed out.<br><br>Drakon took a long, slow breath before speaking again, not looking at Morgan&#x2019;s furious eyes, gazing out of a face gone stone-cold. &#x201c;I have my reasons. I always have my reasons for taking a chance on someone.&#x201d;<br><br>He knew she would catch the reference. Morgan herself, judged barely stable enough for duty after a disastrous mission into enigma space, had been turned down by every other commanding officer until Drakon gave her an opportunity.<br><br>The fury in Morgan flickered, and her mouth twitched, then she abruptly went back into projecting jaded amusement. &#x201c;Sometimes that might work out. But I&#x2019;m one of a kind, General.&#x201d;<br><br><i>Fortunately</i>, Drakon thought. <i>Could the universe handle more than one Rho Morgan? </i>&#x201c;Get the snipers stood down and work with Rogero, Kai, and Gaiene to get forces deployed to defend against a landing. We&#x2019;ve got plenty of time to get people dispersed and dug in. Maybe the enigmas will sit in orbit...</p><h2>This Is Me: Loving the Person You Are Today</h2><p><p><strong>#1<em> NEW YORK TIMES</em> BESTSELLER</strong></p><p><strong>An inspirational book about life and its lessons from the Golden Globe and Emmy nominated star of NBC&#x2019;s </strong><strong><em>This Is Us.</em></strong></p><p>When<em> This Is Us</em> debuted in fall 2016, a divided America embraced a show that celebrates human connection. The critically acclaimed series became America&#x2019;s most watched&#x2014;and most talked about&#x2014;network show, even building on its fan base in the drama&#x2019;s second season. As Kate Pearson, Chrissy Metz presents a character that has never been seen on television, yet viewers see themselves in her, no matter what they look like or where they come from. Considered a role model just for being her authentic self, Chrissy found herself on magazine covers and talk shows, walking red carpets, and as the subject of endless conversations on social media &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;ve been through to play her,&#x201d; she is often told by fans, &#x201c;but it was something.&#x201d;</p><p>In <em>This is Me,</em> Chrissy Metz shares her story with a raw honesty that will leave readers both surprised but also inspired. Infused with the same authenticity she brings to her starring role, Chrissy&#x2019;s <em>This is Me</em> is so much more than your standard Hollywood memoir or collection of personal essays. She embraces the spirit of Shonda Rhimes&#x2019; <em>Year of Yes</em>, and shares how she has applied the lessons she learned from both setbacks and successes. A born entertainer, Chrissy finds light in even her darkest moments, and leaves the reader feeling they are spending time with a friend who gets it.</p><p>Chrissy Metz grew up in a large family, one that always seemed to be moving, and growing. Her father disappeared one day, leaving her mother to work a series of menial jobs and his children to learn to live with the threat of hunger and the electricity being cut off. When her mother remarried, Chrissy hoped for &#x201c;normal&#x201d; but instead experienced a form of mental pain that seemed crafted just for her. The boys who showed her attention did so with strings attached as well, and Chrissy accepted it, because for her, love always came with conditions. </p><p>When she set out for Los Angeles, it was the first time she had been away from her family and from Florida. And for years, she got barely an audition. So how does a woman with the deck stacked against her radiate such love, beauty and joy? This too is at the heart of <em>This is Me</em>. &nbsp;</p><p>With chapters that alternate from autobiographical to instructional, Chrissy offers practical applications of her hard-won insights in a series of &#x201c;Bee Mindful&#x201d; interstitials. There she invites you to embrace gratitude in &#x201c;Say Thank You&#x201d; or to be honest with your partner and yourself in &#x201c;The Shrouded Supreme.&#x201d; Blending love and experience, Chrissy encourages us all to claim our rightful place in a world that may be trying to knock us down, find our own unique gifts, and pursue our dreams. </p></p><p><p>HEY HEY!</p><p>When<em> This Is Us</em> first debuted, a divided America embraced a show that celebrates human connection. When I hear from our viewers, you tell me how you relate to the humor, depth, and vibrance of my character, Kate Pearson. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what you&#x2019;ve been through to play her,&#x201d; I was told recently, &#x201c;but it must be&nbsp;something.&#x201d;</p><p>So I decided to share my struggles and triumphs. I want you to join me on my journey not just of self-acceptance, but of becoming the person <em>we</em> are meant to be. To move forward, I first had to look back to my early years in Gainesville, Florida. When my father left us, my life slowly devolved into the survival mode of trailer-park living. My mother married a new man, and at first I thought it was a new start, but instead it became a nightmare of humiliation over my weight. I started keeping secrets, whether it was about eating my feelings or my first love, a boy who truly cared for me but only when no one was watching.</p><p>No matter what, I always had a flicker of hope that my life could be what I wanted. It drew me to Los Angeles, where I soon realized Hollywood gave women two options: size zero or sight gag. I found real love, got married, then got divorced, which broke my heart even if it was the right choice for us. The night of my thirtieth birthday, I was in a movie theater and thought I was having a heart attack. That was the catalyst for real change in my life&#x2014;changes that brought me to <em>This Is Us</em>, and, through this book, to you.</p><p>In <em>This Is Me</em>, I want to give you an action plan for fulfilling your destiny and passion. I want to be that best friend in your head, sharing the are-you-kidding-me, I-wish-I-was moments that only come from being honest in giving life advice from my personal experience. Should you text that guy back? (No. Seriously,&nbsp;<em>don&#x2019;t.</em>) What do you wear to Oprah&#x2019;s house for lunch? And how exactly do you resist punching that beeyotch at work?&nbsp;</p><p>Like many people, I have used food to fill the void and numb the pain. I have met enough people to know that whatever form that coping mechanism takes, what isn&#x2019;t helping you is hurting you. We can change, and we can have the lives we want and deserve. So whether you are a young hopeful or a late bloomer, I wrote&nbsp;<em>This Is Me</em> with you in mind.</p><p>Chrissy Metz is an actress best known for her role in <em>This Is Us</em>.

He was famously militaristic, yet brokered peace between Russia and Japan. He started out an archconservative, yet came to champion progressive causes. These contradictions are not evidence of vacillating weakness: instead, they were the product of a restless mind bend on a continuous quest for self-improvement. <br><br> In <b>Theodore Roosevelt</b>, historian Kathleen Dalton reveals a man with a personal and intellectual depth rarely seen in our public figures. She shows how Roosevelt&#x2019;s struggle to overcome his frailties as a child helped to build his character, and offers new insights into his family life, uncovering the important role that Roosevelt&#x2019;s second wife, Edith Carow, played in the development of his political career. She also shows how TR flirted with progressive reform and then finally commited himself to deep reform in the Bull Moose campaign of 1912. Incorporating the latest scholarship into a vigorous narrative, Dalton reinterprets both the man and his times to create an illuminating portrait that will change the way we see this great man and the Progressive Era.</p><p>Biographers have often treated Theodore Roosevelt as "a larger-than-life monument carved in stone, unchanging, far from being flesh and blood, and quite imperturbable." So writes Kathleen Dalton, who gives us a fully fleshed, quite down-to-earth TR in this vigorous, sometimes critical biography of the 26th president.<p> Roosevelt carefully crafted an image of himself as a self-made man. Fair enough, Dalton suggests, though he had a big head start in coming from one of New York's wealthiest and best-connected families. More than shaping his body to overcome weakness, his spirit to overcome fear, he had to overcome the prejudices of his time and class in order to be truly fit for leadership, and even as president he wrestled with a few contradictions (opposing, for instance, a woman's right to divorce, but endorsing public flogging of spousal abusers). He was not always successful, Dalton writes, but he emerged in the end as a great champion of civil rights and of the middle and working classes, very much ahead of his time.</p><p> There's a lot of interest in Theodore Roosevelt these days--and for good reason, given the recent international turmoil and financial tumble, which, some would argue, beg for TR's patented big-stick and trust-busting treatment. Dalton's <i>Theodore Roosevelt</i> offers a satisfying portrait of a constantly fascinating subject. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><br>"Kathleen Dalton's <i>Theodore Roosevelt: A Strenuous Life</i> is a brave, bold, revisionist study of the most multidimensional of our American Presidents. Debunking academic notions that TR was a jingoistic nativist, Dalton establishes the Sage of Oyster Bay as an open-minded public servant crusading for social justice. She leaves the reader convinced that there was a bedrock sanity to TR's irascible manic behaviour. A truly remarkable biography."<br>--Douglas Brinkley<br><br>&#x201c;Kathleen Dalton's engaging full-length biography of Theodore Roosevelt is distinguished throughout by her fresh findings about TR's family life and her keen interest in his progressively social and economic views in his last decade. She presents a convincing assessment of the positive influence of women's concerns on TR's beliefs and policies, and she writes compellingly of his essentially moral commitment to federal regulation of corporations. Imaginatively researched and unflaggingly interesting, THEODORE ROOSEVELT is intimate, insightful, and informing. Readers familiar with TR and readers just coming to him will enjoy and be enlightened by it.&#x201d;<br>--William H. Harbaugh, author of POWER AND RESPONSIBILITY (bio of TR, 1961)<br><br>&#x201c;Like its subject, this book is charming and intellectually sound. And at last, someone pays serious attention to TR's scientific interests and achievements.&#x201d; <br>&#x2014;Stephen Jay Gould<br><br>&#x201c;At a time when we yearn for great moral leadership and conviction, Kathleen Dalton brings back to us a man who marvelously embraced these qualities, in a continually dramatic account told with skill and grace.&#x201d;<br>---James MacGregor Burns</p><h2>The End of Imagination</h2><p><i>The End of Imagination</i> brings together five of Arundhati Roy's acclaimed books of essays into one comprehensive volume for the first time and features a new introduction by the author.<br><br>This new collection begins with her pathbreaking book <i>The Cost of Living</i> published soon after she won the Booker Prize for her novel <i>The God of Small Things</i> in which she forcefully condemned India&#x2019;s nuclear tests and its construction of enormous dam projects that continue to displace countless people from their homes and communities. <i>The End of Imagination</i> also includes her nonfiction works <i>Power Politics</i>, <i>War Talk</i>, <i>Public Power in the Age of Empire</i>, and <i>An Ordinary Person&#x2019;s Guide to Empire</i>, which include her widely circulated and inspiring writings on the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the need to confront corporate power, and the hollowing out of democratic institutions globally.</p><p><b>Arundhati Roy</b> studied architecture in New Delhi, where she now lives.

That must tell us some profound truth. But what? I wonder.&#x201d;<br> <br>The picture he was talking about was Simon Alpheton&#x2019;s <i>Marc and Harriet in Orcadia Place,</i> later bought by Tate Britain&#x2014;simply &#x201c;the Tate&#x201d; in those days&#x2014;and the house the one in the picture, Orcadia Cottage. His remark about the curious world was addressed to the Harriet of the picture, for whom he had bought it and whom he intended to marry when his divorce came through. Later on, when passion had cooled and they were husband and wife, Franklin said, &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t want to get married. I married you because I&#x2019;m a man of honour and you were my mistress. Some would say my views are out-of-date, but I dispute that. The apparent change is only superficial. I reasoned that no one would want my leavings, so for your sake, the decent thing was to make an honest woman of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>His first wife was Anthea. When he deserted her, he was also obliged to desert their dog, O&#x2019;Hara, and to him that was the most painful thing about it.<br> <br>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t keep a bitch and bark yourself,&#x201d; he said to Harriet when she protested at having to do all the housework.<br> <br>&#x201c;Pity I&#x2019;m not an Irish setter,&#x201d; she said, and had the satisfaction of seeing him wince.<br> <br>They lived together for five years and were married for twenty-three, the whole time in that house, Orcadia Cottage or number 7a Orcadia Place, London NW8. Owing to Franklin&#x2019;s sharp tongue, verbal cruelty, and indifference, and to Harriet&#x2019;s propensity for sleeping with young tradesmen in the afternoons, it was not a happy marriage. They took separate holidays, Franklin going away ostensibly on his own but in fact with his first wife, and he came back from the last one only to tell Harriet he was leaving. He returned to Anthea and her present Irish setter, De Valera, intending to divorce Harriet as soon as feasible. Anthea, a generous woman, urged him to do his best to search for her, for Harriet couldn&#x2019;t be found at Orcadia Cottage. The largest suitcase, most of her clothes, and the best of the jewellery he had bought her were missing, and Franklin&#x2019;s belief was that she had gone off with her latest young man.<br> <br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;ll be in touch as soon as she&#x2019;s in need,&#x201d; said Franklin to Anthea, &#x201c;and that won&#x2019;t be long delayed.&#x201d;<br> <br>But Harriet never got in touch. Franklin went back to Orcadia Cottage to look for some clue to where she might have gone but found only that the place was exceptionally neat, tidy, and clean.<br> <br>&#x201c;One odd thing,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I lived there for all those years and never went into the cellar. There was no reason to do so. Just the same, I could have sworn there was a staircase going down to it with a door just by the kitchen door. But there isn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>Anthea was a much cleverer woman than Harriet. &#x201c;When you say you could have sworn, darling, do you mean you would go into court, face a jury, and say, &#x2018;I swear there was a staircase in that house going down to the cellar&#x2019;?&#x201d;<br> <br>After thinking about it, Franklin said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so. Well, no, I wouldn&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>He put the house on the market and bought one for Anthea and himself in South Kensington. In their advertisements the estate agents described Orcadia Cottage as &#x201c;the Georgian home immortalized in the internationally acclaimed artwork of Simon Alpheton.&#x201d; The purchasers, an American insurance broker and his wife, wanted to move in quickly, and when Franklin offered them the report his own surveyors had made thirty years before, they were happy to do without a survey. After all, the house had been there for two hundred years and wasn&#x2019;t likely to fall down now.<br> <br>CLAY AND DEVORA SILVERMAN bought the house from Franklin Merton in 1998 and lived there until 2002 before returning to the house they had rented out in Hartford, Connecticut. The first autumn they spent at Orcadia Cottage the leaves on the Virginia creeper which covered the entire front and much of the back of the house turned from green to copper and copper to red and then started to fall off. Clay Silverman watched them settle on the front garden and the paving stones in the back. He was appalled by the red, sticky, sodden mass of leaves on which he and Devora slipped and slid and Devora sprained her ankle. Knowing nothing about natural history and still less about gardening, he was well-informed about art and was familiar with the Alpheton painting. It was one of his reasons for buying Orcadia Cottage. But he had assumed that the green leaves covering the house that formed the background to the lovers&#x2019; embrace remained green always and remained on the plant. After all of them had fallen, he had the creeper cut down.<br> <br>Orcadia Cottage emerged as built of bricks in a pretty pale red colour. Clay had shutters put on the windows and the front door painted a pale greenish gray. In the paved yard at the back of the house was what he saw as an unsightly drain cover with a crumbling stone pot on top of it. He had a local nursery fill a tub with senecios, heathers, and cotoneaster to replace the pot. But four years later he and Devora moved out and returned home. Clay Silverman had given �800,000 for the house and sold it for �1.5 million to Martin and Anne Rokeby.<br> <br>The Rokebys had a son and daughter; there were only two bedrooms in Orcadia Cottage, but one was large enough to be divided and this was done. For the first time in nearly half a century the house was home to children. Again there was no survey on the house, for Martin and Anne paid cash and needed no mortgage. They moved into Orcadia Cottage in 2002 and had been living there for four years, their children teenagers by this time, when Martin raised the possibility with his wife of building underground. Excavations to construct an extra room or two&#x2014;a wine cellar, say, or a &#x201c;family room,&#x201d; a study, or all of those things&#x2014;were becoming fashionable. You couldn&#x2019;t build on to your historic house or add an extra story, but the planning authority might let you build subterraneanly. A similar thing had been done in Hall Road, which was near Orcadia Place, and Martin had watched the project with interest.<br> <br>A big room under Orcadia Cottage would be just the place for their children to have a large-screen television, their computers, their ever-more-sophisticated arrangements for making music, and maybe an exercise room too for Anne, who was something of a workout fanatic. In the late summer of 2006 Martin began by consulting the builders who had divided the large bedroom, but they had gone out of business. A company whose board outside the Hall Road house gave their name, phone number, and an e-mail address were next. But the men who came round to have a look said it wouldn&#x2019;t be feasible. A different firm was recommended to him by a neighbour. One who came said he thought it could be done. Another said it was possible if Martin didn&#x2019;t mind losing all the mature trees in the front garden.<br> <br>Martin and Anne and the children all went to Australia for a month. The house was too old, prospective builders said; it would be unwise to disturb the foundations. Others said it could be done but at a cost twice that which Martin had estimated. They said all this on the phone without even looking at it. Nevertheless, he applied to the planning authority for permission to build underneath the house. The project was put an end to when planning permission was refused, having had a string of protests from all the Rokebys&#x2019; neighbours except the one who had recommended the builder.<br> <br>All this took about a year. In the autumn of 2007 the Rokebys&#x2019; son, who had been the principal family member in favour of the underground room, went off to university. Time went on and the plan was all but forgotten. The house seemed bigger now their daughter was away at boarding school. In the early spring of 2009 Martin and Anne went on holiday to Florence. There, in a shop on the Arno, Anne fell in love with a large amphora displayed in its window.

Stephen Long, is the pursuit of God's goodness by people "on the way" to a city not built by human hands. The cultivation of practical wisdom that comes from diverse sources, it draws on all that is good in God's creation and among the nations. In this <em>Very Short Introduction</em>, Long examines these diverse sources, discusses the relationship between Christian, modern, and postmodern ethics, and explores practical issues including sex, money, and power. The book also examines some of the failures of the Christian tradition, including the crusades, the conquest, slavery, inquisitions, and the Galileo affair. Placing them in the context of the theory and practice of ethics and their historical perspective, Long notes the challenges they raise for Christian ethics. He concludes with a discussion of their implications in the modern era, considering how this affects our lives in the present age. Long recognizes the inherent difficulties in bringing together "Christian" and "ethics" but argues that this is an important task for both the Christian faith and for ethics.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong> Combining authority with wit, accessibility, and style, <strong>Very Short Introductions </strong>offer an introduction to some of life's most interesting topics.

My son is twenty-five now and I feel blessed to be his mom. I live in beautiful Northern California, but I was born in the warm sunny state of Florida in 1963. My youth was spent in the South... Florida, Texas, and Oklahoma. I miss the loud rumble of thunder storms, lightning bolting across the sky, and family. I wish I could, but I can&#39;t say that I was ever prepared in any way to have become a writer. I just fell in love with reading and writing at a late stage in my life. But the good thing about indie culture is that it let&#39;s, and even encourages people like me to just go for it! I found out that wanting to make my story better, gave me vision and desire to study so that I can learn my chosen craft. I am as excited about learning as I am about the actual writing. So right now I am happy being a mom, reading good books in quiet cozy places and writing my second novel. I love to hear the sound of waves crashing on the shore, raindrops on a tin roof and a happy babies laughter. My days start with gratitude, hot coffee with lots of milk, and prayer. For every girl and guy who reads (The Sleeper) I just want to say, &#34;Thank you!&#34; With all my love and prayers for each and every one of you. It took me more than a few times to get this story closer to where I wanted it to be. If you read it before it got some &#34;a million&#34; rewrites sorry. I know it was an ugly hot mess in process! There were also many cover changes while I was learning as well. Yikes! Too may cover changes! My deepest desire for this story is that it open some windows and shed some spiritual light in for many of us Christians that have experienced and even been intrigued by the vampire phenomenon.

Fully updated and revised, this Third Edition includes a wealth of new material and case examples, while retained sections have been carefully rewritten to reflect contemporary thinking. This important text continues to provide understanding and empathy regarding the plight of battered women as they attempt to find safety. The integration of current knowledge with learning theory explains how any woman's previous life experiences along with the effects of battering might influence her to stay with her abuser. The book's content also explains how some social institutions, such as the criminal justice system, cannot be counted upon to protect her, thus making it dangerous for her to leave or stay. In extreme cases, she may even be killed. From a more optimistic viewpoint, the book describes many innovations geared to assist battered women through shelters, transitional housing, and temporary income support. This extensively revised and expanded new edition is a must read for anyone working in or training to work in a helping role for issues in domestic violence.</p><p><p><b>Alyce LaViolette </b>has worked with battered women since 1978, first as an advocate at Women Shelter in Long Beach and then in private practice.

A comprehensive glossary includes character names, place names, and all unfamiliar words, as well as words whose pronunciation is affected by the iambic pentameter line. A respelling system and phonetic transcriptions make this guide accessible to an audience ranging from high-school students to academic specialists. All The Words on Stage also includes a chapter on verse scansion and an appendix detailing language usage specific to each play.</p><p>Louis Scheeder is founder and director of the Classical Studio, an advanced training program in the Department of Drama at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts. He has directed plays on, off, off-off Broadway, and at regional theaters in the US and Canada. He has worked at the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Manitoba Theatre Centre, and the Folger Theatre Group. He also directs both dance and performance.<p> Shane Ann Younts teaches Techniques of Voice and Text classes in the Graduate Acting Department at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, specializing in the texts of Shakespeare. She also teaches and coaches actors for theater, film, and television at her Manhattan studio. She has served as Voice Consultant for Broadway, off-Broadway, and regional theater productions including The Guthrie Theater, The Public Theater and The Pearl Theatre. She previously taught at The Public Theater's Summer Shakespeare Lab, The Juilliard School (Drama Division), The American Academy of dramatic Arts, and NYU (Undergraduate Drama) in the Classical Studio.</p>By exploring the mechanics of Shakespeare's writing, these books clearly illustrate how to speak and understand his texts and ultimately break down the language barrier. Both cover the bard's powerful iambic pentameter and its effect on pronunciation, the irregularities that reveal the emotional and psychological state of each character, and how each word works in relation to another concerning prose, verse, blank verse, and rhyming verse. Scheeder, founder and director of the Classical Studio at New York University, and Younts, professor of the techniques of voice and text at the same institution, present a highly useful pronunciation dictionary, supplemented by a glossary that defines character names, places, and unfamiliar words. They use the International Phonetics Alphabet, respell vowels in their key to pronunciation, and intricately mark in scansion each word. When a word can be pronounced two different ways, they indicate both followed by the play, the act, and the scene in which each form is used. Rodenburg, director of voice at London's Royal National Theatre, divides her training guide into four parts, offering practical exercises that aid in comprehending the speeches that define a character's mental state and intentions. Her book uses two guideposts: the givens (including the word, the line, rhyme, and the story) and the imaginative connections necessary to make a piece engaging to both the actor and the audience. Many books exist to help actors approach Shakespeare's works, but they tend toward more general overviews. Both of these books are rich with information and nicely focused.

Lauren Benton argues that Europeans imagined imperial space as networks of corridors and enclaves, and that they constructed sovereignty in ways that merged ideas about geography and law. Conflicts over treason, piracy, convict transportation, martial law, and crime created irregular spaces of law, while also attaching legal meanings to familiar geographic categories such as rivers, oceans, islands, and mountains. The resulting legal and spatial anomalies influenced debates about imperial constitutions and international law both in the colonies and at home. This original study changes our understanding of empire and its legacies and opens new perspectives on the global history of law.</p><p>A Search for Sovereignty examines the relation of law and geography in European empires, exploring spatial patterns of treason, piracy, convict transportation, and martial law in European empires between 1400 and 1900.

Covering an extensive period&#x2015;from the earliest Greek texts in the late seventh century b.c.e. to Greco-Roman texts of the third and fourth centuries c.e.&#x2015;the volume includes well-known writings by Plato, Sappho, Aeschines, Catullus, and Juvenal, as well as less well known but highly relevant and intriguing texts such as graffiti, comic fragments, magical papyri, medical treatises, and selected artistic evidence. These fluently translated texts, together with Thomas K. Hubbard's valuable introductions, clearly show that there was in fact no more consensus about homosexuality in ancient Greece and Rome than there is today. <br><br>The material is organized by period and by genre, allowing readers to consider chronological developments in both Greece and Rome. Individual texts each are presented with a short introduction contextualizing them by date and, where necessary, discussing their place within a larger work. Chapter introductions discuss questions of genre and the ideological significance of the texts, while Hubbard's general introduction to the volume addresses issues such as sexual orientation in antiquity, moral judgments, class and ideology, and lesbianism. With its broad, unexpurgated, and thoroughly informed presentation, this unique anthology gives an essential perspective on homosexuality in classical antiquity.</p><p>"Professor Hubbard has had the generosity and good sense to include fragmentary as well as complete texts, and inscriptions and graffiti as well as properly literary works. The translations by divers hands faithfully represent an enormously wide range of genres and both high and colloquial styles, and the Greek and Latin texts are intelligently grouped into ten chapters by period and subject-matter, each introduced and annotated by the editor. There is an excellent selection of illustrations, including the fetishistic Roman-period Warren Cup recently purchased by the British Museum, that depicts both pederastic sodomy and voyeurism."&#x2015;Paul Cartledge, author of <i>Spartan Reflections</i> <br><br>"It would be difficult to find a way to overstate the value of Hubbard&#x2019;s contribution to our study of ancient sex and sexuality. Even those who think they know all about these topics are in for some surprises when they explore this vast collection of primary texts from the ancient Mediterranean world. Students, too, will find a great feast of information spread before them. The selection is comprehensive, and the English translations are carefully chosen. My first question, as I began to understand the nature of the sourcebook I held in my hands, was: Why has no one done this before?"&#x2015;John T. Kirby, author of <i>Secret of the Muses Retold </i> <br><br>"Hubbard has achieved a remarkable feat. He has collected the literary and historical (and some artistic) evidence documenting same-sex eroticism in ancient Greece and Rome, in all its varieties. He introduces these sources to the general reader by period and author and analyzes controversial issues such as essentialism vs. social constructivism and the very rubric homosexuality, and he traces changing attitudes toward diverse homoerotic practices. His Sourcebook provides readers with just the right amount of background on changing social and political contexts from Greece to Rome, and introduces the full range of scholarship on a broad and important topic. It will fascinate and educate all those interested in the history of sexuality and, in practical terms, it will facilitate teaching and research in Gay Studies and indeed in Cultural Studies and Ancient History."&#x2015;Nancy Felson, author of <i>Regarding Penelope: From Character to Poetics </i><b>Thomas K. Hubbard </b>is Professor of Classics at the University of Texas, Austin, and author of <i>The Pipes of Pan: Intertextuality and Literary Filiation in the Pastoral Tradition from Theocritus to Milton </i>(1998) and <i>The Mask of Comedy: Aristophanes and the Intertextual Parabasis </i>(1991), among other books.</p><h2>The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History</h2><p><p><i>The Thirty Years War: A Documentary History</i> fills a gap in recent studies of the great pan-European conflict, providing fresh translations of thirty-eight primary documents for the student and general reader. The selections are drawn from the standard political documents, from the <i>Apology</i> of the Bohemian Estates for the Defenestration of Prague to the text of the Treaty of Westphalia, as well as from imperial edicts, trial records, letters, diary entries, and satirical broadsheets, all directly translated from the Early New High German, French, Swedish, and Latin. The volume contains some ten illustrations and one map . . . and on the whole is well organized and well presented with a judicious amount of footnotes and a slim For Further Reading section. A succinct introduction introduces the four sections, each with its own substantial introduction: (1) Outbreak of the Thirty Years War (1618-1623), (2) The Intervention of Denmark and Sweden (1623-1635), and (3) The Long War (1635-1648). The concluding section (4) Two Wartime Lives (1618-1648), interestingly juxtaposes the journals of a wandering mercenary and a settled townsman. The first is the diary of Peter Hagendorf, kept between the years 1624 and 1649 and only rediscovered in 1993. Hagendorf experienced the war as a common mercenary from the Baltic to Italy, from France to Pomerania. His counterpart is Hans Heberle, a shoemaker from a small town in the territory of the free imperial city of Ulm whose <i>Zeytregister</i> chronicled happenings both in the neighborhood and further afield. The engrossing accounts of their shifting fortunes over the three decades of the war really help to give this collection of texts, and the troublesome period itself, a human face. They are the stuff from which Grimmelshausen would craft his great novel of the war, <i>The Adventuresome Simplicissimus</i> (1668). Tryntje Helfferich is to be applauded for this consistently interesting and eminently useful volume. --Martin W. Walsh, University of Michigan, in <i>Sixteenth Century Journal</i></p></p><p><p>Tryntje Helfferich is Associate Professor of History, The Ohio State University at Lima.</p><p>[A] remarkable collection. . . provides a riveting eyewitness account. . . superb. --<i>Times Literary Supplement</i></p><br><br><p>There is, to my knowledge, no other book of this sort in English that competes in giving a detailed account of the Thirty Years War. Helfferich has done a remarkable job in assembling texts that convey the sweep of the war, the religious and constitutional questions involved, the international involvement of especially Denmark, Sweden, and France, and the turbulent misery that the war produced, especially in the Holy Roman Empire. I do not know of a better representation of what the Peace of Westphalia (the two treaties, at Osnabr�ck and M�nster) actually settled. Helfferich has done a fine job of accurately translating from German and other languages . . . and she has chosen rather large documents for inclusion instead of snipping out small paragraphs from many more documents. One thus has a chance to settle into an author's main points and to appreciate his or her style and point of view. --Erik Midelfort, University of Virginia</p></p><h2>Ordinary Differential Equations (The MIT Press)</h2><p><p>Few books on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) have the elegant geometric insight of this one, which puts emphasis on the qualitative and geometric properties of ODEs and their solutions, rather than on routine presentation of algorithms.</p></p><p>From the reviews: &#34;...

Geoffrey Wawro describes Prussia&#39;s successful invasion of Habsburg Bohemia, and the wretched collapse of the Austrian army in July 1866. Blending military and social history, he describes the panic that overtook Austria&#39;s regiments in each clash with the Prussians. He reveals the blundering of the Austrian commandant who fumbled away key strategic advantages and ultimately lost a war--crucial to the fortunes of the Habsburg Monarchy--that most European pundits had predicted they would win.</p><p>Geoffrey Wawro recounts the story of this crucial European war, from its diplomatic origins to its pivotal battles. This is the first history of the Austro-Prussian War in more than thirty years, and the first ever to be based upon extensive research in the political and military archives of Austria, France, Germany, Italy, and England. Wawro has reconstructed the Austrian campaign, blow-by-blow, hour-by-hour. He divulges the secrets of Prussian military success, as well as the dismal, sometimes lurid reasons for Austria&#39;s military collapse and Italy&#39;s near collapse. The book is most notable for the light it sheds on the Habsburg war effort."The Franco-Prussian War of 1870-1871 started the modern Hundred Years' War that did not end until 1945. Professor Geoff Wawro's book is the most comprehensive treatment of the subject. Thoughtful and well written, it is a major contribution to an understanding of history."

In our case, we are refining data about people, locations, social interactions, traffic, musical preferences, and so on to bring maps to life. <br><br>The analytical leaders profiled in this book demonstrate how to refine data for business gain and innovation.

As James R. Newman put it, Maxwell "combined a profound physical intuition, an exquisite feeling for the relationship of objects, with a formidable mathematical capacity to establish orderly connections among diverse phenomena. This blending of the concrete and the abstract was the chief characteristic of almost all his researches."<br>Maxwell's work on heat and statistical physics has long been recognized as vitally important, but <i>Theory of Heat,</i> his own masterful presentation of his ideas, remained out of print for years before being brought back in this new edition. In this unjustly neglected classic, Maxwell sets forth the fundamentals of thermodynamics clearly and simply enough to be understood by a beginning student, yet with enough subtlety and depth of thought to appeal also to more advanced readers. He goes on to elucidate the fundamental ideas of kinetic theory, and &#x2014; through the mental experiment of "Maxwell's demon" &#x2014; points out how the Second Law of Thermodynamics relies on statistics.<br>A new Introduction and notes by Peter Pesic put Maxwell's work into context and show how it relates to the quantum ideas that emerged a few years later. Theory of Heat will serve beginners as a sound introduction to thermal physics; advanced students of physics and the history of science will find Maxwell's ideas stimulating, and will be delighted to discover this inexpensive reprint of a long-unavailable classic.</p><p></p></p><p>Published in 1871, this masterly account of thermodynamics and statistical mechanics derived the &#39;Maxwell relations&#39;, which still feature in every standard thermodynamics text. The book also introduced the famous and controversial idea soon to be known as Maxwell&#39;s &#39;demon&#39;, which seemed to contradict the second law of thermodynamics.<p><b>James Clerk Maxwell: In His Own Words &#x2014; And Others <br></b>Dover reprinted Maxwell's <i>Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism</i> in 1954, surely one of the first classics of scientific literature over a thousand pages in length to be given new life and accessibility to students and researchers as a result of the paperback revolution of the 1950s. <i>Matter and Motion</i> followed in 1991 and <i>Theory of Heat</i> in 2001. </p><p> </p><p>Some towering figures in science have to speak for themselves. Such is James Clerk Maxwell (1813&#x2013;1879), the Scottish physicist and mathematician who formulated the basic equations of classical electromagnetic theory. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"We may find illustrations of the highest doctrines of science in games and gymnastics, in traveling by land and by water, in storms of the air and of the sea, and wherever there is matter in motion." </p><p> </p><p>"The 2nd law of thermodynamics has the same degree of truth as the statement that if you throw a tumblerful of water into the sea, you cannot get the same tumblerful of water out again." &#x2014; James Clerk Maxwell </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>Critical Acclaim for James Clerk Maxwell:<br></b>"From a long view of the history of mankind &#x2014; seen from, say, ten thousand years from now &#x2014; there can be little doubt that the most significant event of the 19th century will be judged as Maxwell's discovery of the laws of electrodynamics. The American Civil War will pale into provincial insignificance in comparison with this important scientific event of the same decade." &#x2014; Richard P. Feynman </p><p> </p><p>"Maxwell's equations have had a greater impact on human history than any ten presidents." &#x2014; Carl Sagan</p></p><h2>Reflections on the Revolution in France (Select works of Edmund Burke, Volume 2)</h2><p>Originally published by Oxford University Press in the 1890s, the famed three-volume Payne edition of <i>Select Works</i> is universally revered by students of English history and political thought. Faithfully reproduced in each volume are E. J. Payne's notes and introductory essays. Francis Canavan, one of the great Burke scholars of the twentieth century, has added forewords.<br><br>Volume 2 consists of Burke's most renowned work, <b><i>Reflections on the Revolution in France</i></b>. In it, he excoriates French revolutionary leaders for recklessly destroying France's venerable institutions and way of life. He attempts not only to explain the events of the new revolution to his readers but also to persuade them that the revolution menaces the civilization of Europe in general and that of Britain in particular. In addition, he articulates a coherent political countertheory that organizes his own beliefs about God, humanity, and society.<br><br>This is Burke's most famous work, for over two centuries read, discussed, and pondered by thousands of students and general readers as well as by professional scholars.<br><br><p><b>Francis Canavan </b>(1917-2009) was Professor&nbsp;of Political Science at Fordham University from 1966 until his retirement in 1988.</p></p><p>British orator, statesman, political thinker and an advocate of many human rights causes. Burke later emerged as the advocate of the Feudal Association in Europe and as time passed by, he became more ardent in his criticism of the French Revolution.</p><h2>Solutions for Singers: Tools for Performers and Teachers</h2><p>While many texts and courses on the art of singing offer comprehensive overviews of technique and performance, few have time to delve into the specific questions they spawn. <em>Solutions for Singers</em> explores these unanswered questions, filling in gaps that professional performers, students of singing, and voice teachers have long sought to close.<br><br>Fielding over 200 questions, distinguished teacher and performer Richard Miller tackles problems raised during hundreds of his master classes and pedagogy courses. He deliberately avoids abstract generalities, concentrating instead on specific, recurring questions: What are some good exercises to loosen or relax tension in the back of the tongue? Do you apply the same principles regarding breathing to a younger student that you do to older students? What is meant by voiced and unvoiced consonants? Is there a female falsetto? Through such specialized questions, Miller probes the very essence of artistic expression.<br><br>The questions are organized under ten broad topics, which Miller considers from various angles. He couples traditional and modern philosophies to present the most relevant and precise solutions. The result is an invaluable handbook for singers, which, read either sequentially or selectively, provides a unique and pragmatic approach to vocal artistry and technique.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Miller</strong> has had a distinguished international performance opera and recital career, is a celebrated masterclass presenter, vocal researcher, competition adjudicator, and prolific author.<br><br>"Miller's contributions to the literature of voice pedagogy are often described with superlatives. <em>Solutions for Singers</em> is no exception. By answering myriad specific questions about the vocal art in a knowledgeable and practical manner, Miller has provided voice teachers and singers with an outstanding resource in the pursuit of beautiful, efficient singing."--<em>Journal of Singing</em><p></p><br>"How would you like to spend a day posing questions and receiving answers with one of the world's most influential voice pedagogues? Richard Miller's latest book, <em>Solutions for Singers</em>, provides just such an opportunity. Written in his clear and engaging style, Miller answers questions gathered from members of his weeklong classes devoted to the art of singing. Highly informative on a wide variety of subjects, <em>Solutions for Singers</em> is written in a style accessible to both the novice and advanced singer and/or voice teacher."--William McIver, Professor of Voice, Eastman School of Music and former NATS President<p></p><br>"Miller combines practical how-to responses with the rigorous thought about history and science that he applies to all of his professional endeavors--an immensely helpful method. Miller rounds out the volume with a glossary, appendixes clarifying pitch designation and International Phonetic Alphabet symbols, a repertoire of songs appropriate for young singers, and a lengthy select biography. Highly recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"We who love singing, and wonder at the mysteries surrounding the production of that marvel of Nature, now have in Richard Miller's newest book--a wellspring of answers to questions asked most frequently by those of us who seek vocal wisdom. This is a welcome addition to Richard Miller's outstanding legacy. It is written in a manner that is accessible, and will prove of lasting value to professional singers, teachers of singing, and amateur performers."--George Shirley, The Joseph Edgar Maddy Distinguished University Professor of Music and Director of the Vocal Arts Division, The University of Michigan School of Music; leading tenor, The Metropolitan Opera, Royal Opera, and Deutsche Oper<p></p><br>"With his usual perception and clarity, Richard Miller has provided answers to a wide range of questions from singers and teachers. This book is filled with information you will not find anywhere else, while at the same time it provides relatively simple explanations about the basic areas of respiration, phonation and resonance. This is an excellent resource for all singers and teachers."--Paul Kiesgen, Chairman, Voice Department, Indiana University School of Music<p></p><br></p><h2>Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy</h2><p>For more than 20 years, <b><i>Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy, Fifth Edition</i></b> has been an illuminating reference for the use of creative approaches in helping clients achieve their therapeutic goals.&nbsp; Carol Crellin Tubbs has included a range of craft and creative activity categories, from paper crafts, to cooking, to the use of recycled materials, and everything in between.<br> &nbsp;<br> Each chapter includes a brief history of the craft, several projects along with suggestions for grading or adapting, examples of related documentation, and a short case study.&nbsp; The text also features chapters on activity analysis, general strategies for implementation of creative activities, and documentation, as well as a chapter describing the relevance of this media from both historical and current occupation-based perspectives.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this updated <b><i>Fifth Edition</i></b>, the craft projects have been updated and numerous resources and links for more ideas have been added.&nbsp; There are new chapters on making therapy tools and crafting with a purpose, and the recycled and found materials chapter has been expanded in keeping with cultural trends.&nbsp; A flow chart has been added to each case study to help students better understand the process and rationale for tailoring activities for individual client needs, and project suggestions for working on specific performance skills or client factors are scattered throughout the chapters.&nbsp; Other additions include a behavioral observation checklist as an aid in evaluation and documentation, and several illustrations to help students distinguish between the use of occupation as means and occupation as end.&nbsp; This <b><i>Fifth Edition</i></b> also includes an updated instructors&#x2019; manual with additional resources and suggestions for lesson planning.<br> &nbsp;<br><b><i>Crafts and Creative Media in Therapy, Fifth Edition</i></b> not only provides a wide assortment of craft ideas and instructions, but also provides multiple suggestions for therapeutic uses for activities in each category.

It blends a familiar language with the formalism and cadence of Victorian descriptions, all the while maintaining clear directions on dissection procedures, and amazing, realistic, art, rendering its reading a vivid experience. It is strongly based in the conceptual framework of phylogeny but without losing the practical spirit of manuals. The incorporation of new sections on examples often not (or ever) included in other works is a bonus that broadens its scope, flexibility, and utility." Dr Sergio F Vizcaino, Departmento Cientifico Paleontologia Vertebrados, Museo de la Plata, Argentina "This new lab manual by De Iuliis and Puler� will quickly become the standard for veterinary and vertebrate zoology courses alike. The artwork is simply the best available, and appears more true-to-life than any others. The choice of including skeletal material beyond the standard fare (including T. rex!) makes this manual truly innovative. The text clearly explains the anatomy, and goes into more detail than any similar manual, allowing the instructor to more easily tailor the manual to his or her course.

It makes it possible for ISPs to connect to each other and for end-users to connect to more than one ISP. BGP is the only protocol that is designed to deal with a network of the Internet's size, and the only protocol that can deal well with having multiple connections to unrelated routing domains.This book is a guide to all aspects of BGP: the protocol, its configuration and operation in an Internet environment, and how to troubleshooting it. The book also describes how to secure BGP, and how BGP can be used as a tool in combating Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Although the examples throughout this book are for Cisco routers, the techniques discussed can be applied to any BGP-capable router.The topics include:</p><ul><li>Requesting an AS number and IP addresses</li><li>Route filtering by remote ISPs and how to avoid this</li><li>Configuring the initial BGP setup</li><li>Balancing the available incoming or outgoing traffic over the available connections</li><li>Securing and troubleshooting BGP</li><li>BGP in larger networks: interaction with internal routing protocols, scalability issues</li><li>BGP in Internet Service Provider networks</li></ul>The book is filled with numerous configuration examples with more complex case studies at the end of the book to strengthen your understanding. <i>BGP</i> is for anyone interested in creating reliable connectivity to the Internet.</p><p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) governs the exchange of routing information among autonomous networks, ensuring that packets can get from point A to point B regardless of most possible problems. <i>BGP</i> explores the capabilities and limitations of this exquisitely important protocol with an eye to teaching network engineers how to build systems that are faster, less costly, and more survivable than ever before. It's a great guide for those responsible for managing the interfaces between large networks and their neighbors, and a valuable aid for people preparing for their Cisco Certified Network Professional (CCNP) tests or other advanced certifications.<p>Authors of protocol-centric books risk becoming bogged down in bits. Iljitsch van Beijnum avoids overwhelming his readers with packet diagrams and message analysis, choosing instead to focus on how routers use BGP to efficiently use available connections (he focuses on Cisco Systems routers in his configuration examples, but the concepts apply universally). He also pays attention--and these sections are among the book's best--to strategies for coping with problems such as cable cuts and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. He understands, and conveys to his readers through network diagrams, configuration listings, and diagnostic traces, that BGP is a tool for managing the points at which networks intersect. <i>--David Wall</i> </p><p> <b>Topics covered:</b> Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), particularly as configured under Cisco Internetwork Operating System (IOS), and its means of describing routes across independently managed networks.

Do you identify primarily as gay, or suburban, or some combination of the two? For that matter, how does anyone decide what his or her identity is?<br><br>In this first-ever ethnography of American gay suburbanites, Wayne H. Brekhus demonstrates that who one is depends at least in part on where and when one is. For many urban gay men, being homosexual is key to their identity because they live, work, and socialize in almost exclusively gay circles. Brekhus calls such men "lifestylers" or peacocks. Chameleons or "commuters," on the other hand, live and work in conventional suburban settings, but lead intense gay social and sexual lives outside the suburbs. Centaurs, meanwhile, or "integrators," mix typical suburban jobs and homes with low-key gay social and sexual activities. In other words, lifestylers see homosexuality as something you are, commuters as something you do, and integrators as part of yourself. <br><br>Ultimately, Brekhus shows that lifestyling, commuting, and integrating embody competing identity strategies that occur not only among gay men but across a broad range of social categories. What results, then, is an innovative work that will interest sociologists, psychologists, anthropologists, and students of gay culture.</p><p><b>Wayne H. Brekhus</b> is an assistant professor of sociology at the University of Missouri-Columbia.</p><h2>Hobbes: A Very Short Introduction</h2><p>Thomas Hobbes (1588-1679) was the first great English political philosopher, and his book <em>Leviathan</em> was one of the first truly modern works of philosophy. Richard Tuck shows that while Hobbes may indeed have been an atheist, he was far from pessimistic about human nature, nor did he advocate totalitarianism. By locating him against the context of his age, we learn that Hobbes developed a theory of knowledge which rivaled that of Descartes in its importance for the formation of modern philosophy.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard Tuck</strong> is Professor of Government at Harvard University. He is the author of <em>Natural Rights Theories</em> (1979) and <em>Philosophy and Government 1572-1651</em> (1993), and has produced editions of Hobbes's <em>Leviathan</em> and (with Michael Silverthorne) <em>De Cive</em>.<br><br>"<em>Review from previous edition</em> "lucid introduction to the first great English political philosopher."--<em>The Times</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Movies and Mental Illness: Using Films to Understand Psychopathology</h2><p>This popular and critically acclaimed text, using movies to help learn about mental illness, has been fully updated with DSM-5 and ICD-10 diagnoses, dozens of evocative and informative frame grabs, a full film index, Authors Picks, sample syllabus, more international films and shorts.....<br><br>Films can be a powerful aid to learning about mental illness and psychopathology for students of psychology, psychiatry, social work, medicine, nursing, counselling, literature or media studies, and for anyone interested in mental health.

It can easily be used by non-healthcare professionals or those who would like a light introduction to mental health without having to digest numerous textbooks, or like myself prefer a different way of learning. --Ibadete Fetahu in NursingTimes.net, September 2015<br><br>In their masterful and entertaining yet thoroughly well-referenced and academic book, Wedding and Niemiec painstakingly provide detailed descriptions of numerous films, with critical thinking questions, references, and fictional patient evaluations ... and in doing so succeed in highlighting cinema as an effective modality for teaching psychopathology and for intellectually challenging students on psychiatric differential diagnosis and treatment.<br>The authors use DSM-5 to arrange their table of contents of 16 chapters. Indeed, the reader can effectively use this book to learn the DSM-5. It is an amazing accomplishment that, for even relatively obscure diagnoses, the authors have ready a diversified portfolio of relevant movies.<br>The 8 appendices are thought-provoking [and] include a sample course syllabus that could serve as an outline to create a successful course to educate students on mental illness, differential diagnosis, and treatment options.<br>I highly recommend this book to educators, mental health care clinicians, and students. --Matthew A. Becker, MD, University of California School of Medicine, in Journal of Clinical Psychiatry, 2015; 76(5):e671<br><br>A winning text for students with pedagogical tips for teachers... Movies and Mental Illness allows educators to weave psychological concepts and issues into a format that naturally engages students and facilitates classroom participation from a shared popular cultural perspective. Empirical data supporting the inclusion of popular film in the curriculum indicates watching contemporary movies can facilitate a wide range of learning outcomes... Abstract concepts, including the wide world of psychopathology, can be brought to life and embodied within movies. Movies grab our attention, stay in our memories, and are often our primary tool for developing narratives of the world.<br> Finding the right film is a daunting and delicate task for teachers. Most instructors don t know where to find the material needed to effectively incorporate this essential media tool. Psychology instructors can now breathe a sigh of relief ... Movies and Mental Illness presents a cornucopia of ideas on how to integrate film as a best practice in the education of students, patients, and the public about mental illness. Wedding and Niemiec s text enables every abnormal or psychopathology instructor to ensure the selected films have been vetted to have maximum positive benefits.<br> The book is best used as an assigned text in an Abnormal Psychology or Psychopathology course but is also very valuable as a reference book used by instructors to build portions of their own syllabi. [It] is especially helpful for instructors trying to incorporate this pedagogy since it provides sample syllabi and gives instructions on how to integrate the use of film within the standard college semester course.<br> Movies &amp; Mental Illness serves not only as a resource for academics, but as a psycho-educational resource for therapists interested in utilizing cinematherapy.<br> Wedding and Niemiec s fourth edition of Movies &amp; Mental Illness will help many psychologists create the ideal learning experience, where students gain an education relevant to their lived experience and clinicians facilitate a client breaking through resistances and reaching their goal. Reviewed by Afiya Mangum Mbilishaka and Linda Berg-Cross, Howard University, Washington, DC, in PsycCRITIQUES (2015);<br>Movies and Mental Illness, 4th Edition by Danny Wedding and Ryan Niemiec is an extraordinary resource for any educators wishing to illustrate complex mental health issues using the popular medium of film. The writing is clear and enjoyable to read. Although the book is specifically designed for an undergraduate psychology course and even includes a sample syllabus, it can readily be applied to graduate medical education. The book is also a helpful resource for clinicians looking to use film in individual or group patient meetings to encourage discussion and reflection. Movies and Mental Illness, 4th Edition is a welcome addition to any clinician or teacher wanting to use film as an engaging supplement for education --; Matt Martin, PhD, Duke/SR-AHEC Family Medicine Residency Program, Fayetteville, NC, in Family Medicine, vol. 47, October 2015</p><h2>Leveraging Chaos: The Mysteries of Leadership and Policy Revealed</h2><p>John R. Shoup and Susan Clark Studer explore the rules and patterns that govern complex systems that, when properly understood and applied, result in more effective leadership than what is offered from traditional leadership models.

It draws together Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, and Protestant scholars to introduce and explain the theory of deification as a biblically rooted, central theme in the Christian doctrine of salvation in diverse eras and traditions. The book addresses the origin, development, and function of deification from its precursors in ancient Greek philosophy to its nuanced use in contemporary theological thought. The revival of interest in deification, which has often been seen as heresy in the Protestant West, heralds a return to foundational understandings of salvation in the Christian church before divisions of East and West, Catholic and Protestant. Originally published in hardcover, this book is now available in paperback to a wider readership.</p><p>"This is a welcome contribution to ecumenical theology! Over the last twenty years the theme of deification has become one of the most significant and fruitful settings of Christian theological dialogue, standing at the nexus between Eastern and Western Christian traditions. But we have lacked--until now--a broad and reliable collection that places the various specialized contributions in perspective and provides a sense of what is at stake. All who are interested in this important topic should begin here!"--<b>Randy L. Maddox</b>, Divinity School, Duke University<br><br>"The contributors to this rich and varied volume have reached across the divides of time, place, and culture to explore the deepest hopes and wildest aspirations of Christians in their relationship with God. Historians, students, ecumenists, and the burgeoning company of enthusiasts for spirituality will all enjoy the abundant and provocative feast that is served up here."--<b>Kathleen McVey</b>, Princeton Theological Seminary<br><br>"This groundbreaking, panoramic collection of studies on the theme of deification/<i>theosis </i>is most welcome. These essays clearly demonstrate that the grand and sublime calling of every human being to participate in the very life of God has always been central in Eastern Orthodox Christianity. I believe this finely conceived and well-crafted volume will help significantly to deepen the understanding and appreciation of salvation as deification for all who read it."--<b>David C. Ford</b>, St. Tikhon's Orthodox Theological Seminary<br><br>"This is a timely book that offers a fuller scope and history of the theme of deification than is possible for a single author. This [can] be a basic textbook for general, wide-ranging courses on 'Deification in the Christian traditions.'"--<b>John Behr</b>, St. Vladimir's Orthodox Theological Seminary<br><br>"These essays analyze the history of exegesis of major biblical passages that teach that the faithful are becoming 'partakers of the divine nature' (2 Peter 1:4). Protestant historical theologians will find instructive the sections on Luther, Calvin, and Wesley, as compared with the Cappadocians, Ephrem, Maximus, and Anselm, as well as more recent writers such as Bulgakov and Karl Rahner.

McKinley</h2><p>Barbara Washburn never set out to become a mountaineering pioneer, but she wasn&#39;t content to be a stay-at-home wife, either. In 1947, defying social convention, Washburn became the first woman to climb Alaska&#39;s Mt. McKinley. She accompanied her husband, Bradford Washburn, on other expeditions to Alaska, the Grand Canyon, and Mt. Everest, while raising three children at their home near Boston. Excerpt: &#34;Reaching the summit had been an emotional experience, and as we were about to begin our descent a funny thing happened. One of the boys announced he had to relieve himself. That gave me courage to confess that I did too. We were all young and modest, and there were no trees to hide behind. Brad responded, &#39;No problem, we have plenty of rope.&#39; He tied the rope around my waist and lowered me down one side of the summit. As I relieved myself, looking over the magnificent scenery, I began to laugh uncontrollably. What would my friends at home think of me now?&#34;</p><p>Barbara Washburn was the first woman to climb Alaska's Mount McKinley, at 20,320 feet the highest peak in North America. The ascent in 1947 was but a single feat of a woman who, by ordinary standards, has lived several lifetimes' worth of adventure. THE ACCIDENTAL ADVENTURER chronicles the life journey of a Massachusetts girl through college to a job at Harvard; her romance with a handsome, irrepressible young scientist and explorer named Bradford Washburn; and her emergence as an Alaskan mountaineering pioneer. Soon after she and Brad Washburn exchanged vows, she found herself a member of a climbing team led by her husband making an ascent of Alaska's Mount Bertha. A first ascent of Mount Hayes followed. Then came her historic climb of Mount McKinley (Danali). The decades that followed brought adventure in many forms as she raised three children, helped map the Grand Canyon, became an award-winning teacher, and traveled the world. In an era when a woman's place was in the home, she climbed - literally - beyond the limitations of her gender, becoming a role model for successive generations of young women who learned anything is possible. Barbara Washburn never set out to become a mountaineering pioneer, but she wasn't content to be a stay-at-home wife, either. In 1947, defying social convention, Washburn became the first woman to climb Alaska's Mt. McKinley. She accompanied her husband, Bradford Washburn, on other expeditions to Alaska, the Grand Canyon, and Mt. Everest, while raising three children at their home near Boston.<br>Barbara Washburn was born in 1914. A graduate of Smith College, she married mountaineer-explorer-mapmaker Bradford Washburn in 1940. Six years later, climbing with her husband, she became the first woman to reach the summit of 20,320-foot Mount McKinley, North America&#39;s highest peak. The mother of three, she also became one of the nation&#39;s earliest remedial reading teachers, and received awards in several fields of endeavour.</p><h2>Dead End Gene Pool: A Memoir</h2><p><b> The great-great-great-great granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt takes a look at the decline of her wealthy blue-blooded family in this irreverent and wickedly funny memoir</b> <br><br> For generations the Burdens were one of the wealthiest families in New York, thanks to the inherited fortune of Cornelius "The Commodore" Vanderbilt. By 1955, the year of Wendy's birth, the Burdens had become a clan of overfunded, quirky and brainy, steadfastly chauvinistic, and ultimately doomed blue bloods on the verge of financial and moral decline-and were rarely seen not holding a drink. <br><br> When her father commits suicide when Wendy is six, she and her brother are told nothing about it and are shuffled off to school as if it were any other day. Subsequently, Wendy becomes obsessed with the macabre, modeling herself after Wednesday Addams of the Addams family, and decides she wants to be a mortician when she grows up. Just days after the funeral, her mother jets off to southern climes in search of the perfect tan, and for the next three years, Wendy and her two brothers are raised mostly by a chain-smoking Scottish nanny and the long suffering household staff at their grandparent's Fifth Avenue apartment. If you think Eloise wreaked havoc at The Plaza you should see what Wendy and her brothers do in "Burdenland"-a world where her grandfather is the president of the Museum of Modern Art; the walls are decorated with originals of Klee, Kline, Mondrian, and Miro; and Rockefellers are regular dinner guests. <br><br> The spoiled life of the uber-rich that they live with their grandparents is in dark contrast to the life they live with their mother, a brilliant Radcliffe grad and Daughter of the American Revolution, who deals with having two men's suicides on her conscience by becoming skinnier, tanner, blonder, and more steeped in bitter alcoholism with every passing year. <br><br> We watch Wendy's family unravel as she travels between Fifth Avenue, Virginia horse country, Mount Desert Island in Maine, the Jupiter Island Club, London, and boarding school, coming through all of it surprisingly intact. Rife with humor, heartbreak, family intrigue, and booze, <i>Dead End Gene Pool</i> offers a glimpse into the eccentric excess of old money and gives truth to the old maxim: The rich are different.<br><br>Watch a Video<p> </p></p><p>Wendy Burden is a confirmed New Yorker who, to her constant surprise, lives in Portland, Oregon. She is the great-great-great-great granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt, which qualifies her to comment freely on the downward spiral of blue blood families. She has worked as an illustrator, a zookeeper, and a taxidermist; and as an art director for a pornographic magazine from which she was fired for being too tasteful. She was also the owner and chef of a small French restaurant, Chez Wendy. She has yet to attend mortuary school, but is planning on it."In this dark and humorous memoir, Wendy Burden takes us inside the family circus that was her side of the Vanderbilt dynasty, bringing American class structure, sibling rivalry, and the decline of the blue bloods vividly to life. It's a wonderful read." <br> -Gus Van Sant <br><br> "An extremely funny writer" <br> -<i>The New York Times</i> <br><br> "It provides a compelling window into a life you're glad you didn't have to live, and the woman who survived it, sense of humor intact." <br> -<i>Boston Globe</i> <br><br> "Charles Addams meets Carrie Bradshaw in this honest, sardonic, and touching memoir. Burden's tale makes for riveting and often hilarious reading." <br> -Jane Stanton Hitchcock, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>Social Crimes and Mortal Friends</i> <br><br> "Burden's acknowledgment that she is focusing her memoir on her father's family (Vanderbilt heirs) because "rich people behaving badly are far more interesting than the not so rich behaving badly" reassures us at the outset that this will not be another standard-issue poor- little-rich-girl memoir. After her father's suicide when Burden was six, she spends her childhood largely ignored, shuttling between the home of her self-centered, globetrotting mother and her eccentric Park Avenue grandparents. Burden offers fascinating and voyeuristic insights into a little-known segment of society, the mega-rich American plutocracy in decline." <br> -<i>Library Journal</i> <br><br> "This blueblood tale is spun so deftly and so charmingly that it is easy to forget that this it is essentially a sad story of family neglect and degeneration. Burden joins the ranks of such memoirists as Augusten Burroughs and David Sedaris, who have successfully mined their dysfunctional childhoods for comedic gold." <br> -<i>Booklist</i> <br><br> "There's great tragedy and sadness that runs through the last three generations of the book's characters, and yet as I write this I find myself laughing at the memory of reading her descriptions and reactions to the world presented to her by fate (and genes). You will too." <br> -<i>New York Social Diary</i></p><h2>Tam Lin</h2><p>In the ancient Scottish ballad "Tam Lin," headstrong Janet defies Tam Lin to walk in her own land of Carterhaugh . . . and then must battle the Queen of Faery for possession of her lover&#x2019;s body and soul. In this version of "Tam Lin," masterfully crafted by Pamela Dean, Janet is a college student, "Carterhaugh" is Carter Hall at the university where her father teaches, and Tam Lin is a boy named Thomas Lane. Set against the backdrop of the early 1970s, imbued with wit, poetry, romance, and magic, Tam Lin has become a cult classic&#x2014;and once you begin reading, you&#x2019;ll know why. This reissue features an updated introduction by the book&#x2019;s original editor, the acclaimed Terri Windling.</p><p>Pamela Dean&nbsp;is an American fantasy author whose most notable book is&nbsp;<i>Tam Lin</i>, based on the&nbsp;Child Ballad&nbsp;of the&nbsp;same name, in which the Scottish fairy&nbsp;story is set on a midwestern college campus loosely based on her alma mater,&nbsp;Carleton College&nbsp;in&nbsp;Minnesota.&nbsp;She was a member of the writing group&nbsp;The Scribblies, and was a contributor to the&nbsp;Liavek&nbsp;shared-world&nbsp;anthologies. She is a member of the&nbsp;Pre-Joycean Fellowship.This delightful new entry in the Fairy Tale series, featuring children's classics refashioned for adult audiences, adapts the eponymous Scottish ballad to a Midwestern university setting. In the early '70s, scholarly Janet Carter enters Blackstock College as an English major. She and roommates Christina and Molly fall in with an attractive, often eccentric group of classics students who circle around Professor Medeous, a spectacular, enigmatic redheaded woman. The girls pair off with young male classicists, Janet beginning an affair with Nicholas Tooley, whose vast familiarity with Shakespeare and often distant approach to intimacy disturb her. When the liaison ends, she takes up with the young man formerly attached to Christina. The ghost of a pregnant student who committed suicide, mysterious late-night horseback forays led by Professor Medeous and the appearance in a list of Shakespeare's actors of the names of three of the Classics Department scholars urge Janet on a dangerous quest to save her lover. Dean ( The Whim of the Dragon ) has written a quintessential college novel, anchoring its fantastic elements in a solid, engaging reality. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Taijiquan Classics: An Annotated Translation</h2><p>Along with Chinese art, medicine, and philosophy, taijiquan has left the confines of its original culture, and offers health, relaxation, and a method of self-defense to people around the globe.

So, when an old family friend offers to put him up for a job in British Intelligence, Alec begins the rigorous selection process for SIS or MI6. Though he doesn't officially make the cut, he is funneled into a prime position at a British oil company with interests in the Caspian Sea. He is directed to befriend Fortner Grice and Katharine Simms, two charismatic employees of Andromeda, a rival American oil firm. Lured into the murky world of industrial espionage, Millius finds himself trapped in a life of secrets and lies, manipulated by MI6 and the CIA, and confronted by the reality of a ruthless business environment in which priceless information can come at the cost of human life.

He lives in London with his family.</p>Chapter One&nbsp;An Exploratory Conversation&nbsp;The door leading into the building is plain and unadorned, save for one highly polished handle. No sign outside saying foreign and commonwealth office, no hint of top brass. There is a small ivory bell on the right-hand side, and I push it. The door, thicker and heavier than it appears, is opened by a fit-looking man of retirement age, a uniformed policeman on his last assignment.&nbsp;"Good afternoon, sir."&nbsp;"Good afternoon. I have an interview with Mr. Lucas at two o'clock."&nbsp;"The name, sir?"&nbsp;"Alec Milius."&nbsp;"Yes, sir."&nbsp;This almost condescending. I have to sign my name in a book and then he hands me a security dog tag on a silver chain, which I slip into the hip pocket of my suit trousers.&nbsp;"Just take a seat beyond the stairs. Someone will be down to see you in a moment."&nbsp;The wide, high-ceilinged hall beyond the reception area exudes all the splendor of imperial England. A vast paneled mirror dominates the far side of the room, flanked by oil portraits of gray-eyed, long-dead diplomats. Its soot-flecked glass reflects the bottom of a broad staircase, which drops down in right angles from an unseen upper story, splitting left and right at ground level. Arranged around a varnished table beneath the mirror are two burgundy leather sofas, one of which is more or less completely occupied by an overweight, lonely-looking man in his late twenties. Carefully, he reads and rereads the same page of the same section of The Times, crossing and uncrossing his legs as his bowels swim in caffeine and nerves. I sit down on the sofa opposite his.&nbsp;Five minutes pass.&nbsp;On the table the fat man has laid down a strip of passport photographs, little color squares of himself in a suit, probably taken in a booth at Waterloo station sometime early this morning. A copy of The Daily Telegraph lies folded and unread beside the photographs. Bland nonstories govern its front page: IRA hints at new ceasefire; rail sell-off will go ahead; 56 percent of British policemen want to keep their traditional bobbies' helmets. I catch the fat man looking at me, a quick spot-check glance between rivals. Then he looks away, shamed. His skin is drained of ultraviolet, a gray flannel face raised on nerd books and Panorama. Black oily Oxbridge hair.&nbsp;"Mr. Milius?"&nbsp;A young woman has appeared on the staircase wearing a neat red suit. She is unflustered, professional, demure. As I stand up, Fat Man eyes me with wounded suspicion, like someone on his lunch break cut in line at the bank.&nbsp;"If you'd like to come with me. Mr. Lucas will see you now."&nbsp;This is where it begins. Following three steps behind her, garbling platitudes, adrenaline surging, her smooth calves lead me up out of the hall. More oil paintings line the ornate staircase.&nbsp;Running a bit late today. Oh, that's okay. Did you find us all right? Yes.&nbsp;"Mr. Lucas is just in here."&nbsp;Prepare a face to meet the faces that you meet.&nbsp;A firm handshake. Late thirties. I had expected someone older. Christ, his eyes are blue. I've never seen a blue like that. Lucas is dense boned and tanned, absurdly handsome in an old-fashioned way. He is in the process of growing a mustache, which undercuts the residual menace in his face. There are black tufts sprouting on his upper lip, cut-rate Errol Flynn.&nbsp;He offers me a drink, an invitation seconded by the woman in red, who seems almost offended when I refuse.&nbsp;"Are you sure?" she says, as if I have broken with sacred tradition. Never accept tea or coffee at an interview. They'll see your hand shaking when you drink it.&nbsp;"Absolutely, yes."&nbsp;She withdraws and Lucas and I go into a large, sparsely furnished room nearby. He has not yet stopped looking at me, not out of laziness or rudeness but purely because he is a man entirely at ease when it comes to staring at people. He's very good at it.&nbsp;He says, "Thank you for coming today."&nbsp;And I say, "It's a pleasure. Thank you for inviting me. It's a great privilege to be here."&nbsp;There are two armchairs in the room, upholstered in the same burgundy leather as the sofas downstairs. A large bay window looks out over the tree-lined Mall, feeding weak, broken sunlight into the room. Lucas has a broad oak desk covered in neat piles of paper and a framed black-and-white photograph of a woman whom I take to be his wife.&nbsp;"Have a seat."&nbsp;I drop down low into the leather, my back to the window. There is a coffee table in front of me, an ashtray, and a closed red file. Lucas occupies the chair opposite mine. As he sits down, he reaches into the pocket of his jacket for a pen, retrieving a blue Mont Blanc. I watch him, freeing the trapped flaps of my jacket and bringing them back across my chest. The little physical tics that precede an interview.&nbsp;"Milius. It's an unusual name."&nbsp;"Yes."&nbsp;"Your father, he was from the Eastern bloc?"&nbsp;"His father. Not mine. Came over from Lithuania in 1940. My family have lived in Britain ever since."&nbsp;Lucas writes something down on a brown clipboard braced between his thighs.&nbsp;"I see. Why don't we begin by talking about your present job. The CEBDO. That's not something I've heard much about."&nbsp;All job interviews are lies. They begin with the r�sum�, a sheet of word-processed fictions. About halfway down mine, just below the name and address, Philip Lucas has read the following sentence:&nbsp;I have been employed as a Marketing Consultant at the Central European Business Development Organization (CEBDO) for the past eleven months.&nbsp;Elsewhere, lower down, are myriad falsehoods: periods of work experience on national newspapers ("Could you do some photocopying please?"); a season as a waiter at a leading Genevan hotel; eight weeks at a London law firm; the inevitable charity work.&nbsp;The truth is that CEBDO is run out of a small, cramped garage in a mews off Edgware Road. The kitchen doubles for a toilet; if somebody has a crap, no one can make a cup of tea for ten minutes. There are five of us: Nik (the boss), Henry, Russell, myself, and Anna. It's very simple. We sit on the phone all day talking to businessmen in central--and now eastern--Europe. I try to persuade them to part with large sums of money, in return for which we promise to place an advertisement for their operation in a publication known as the Central European Business Review. This, I tell my clients, is a quarterly magazine that enjoys a global circulation of four hundred thousand copies, "distributed free around the world." Working purely on commission I can make anything from two to three hundred pounds a week, sometimes more, peddling this story. Nik, I estimate, makes seven or eight times that amount. His only overheads, apart from telephone calls and electricity, are printing costs. These are paid to his brother-in-law who desktop publishes five hundred copies of the Central European Business Review four times a year. These he posts to a few selected embassies across Europe and to all the clients who have placed advertisements in the magazine. Any spares, he throws in the bin.&nbsp;On paper, it's legal.&nbsp;I look Lucas directly in the eye.&nbsp;"The CEBDO is a fledgling organization that advises new businesses in central--and now eastern--Europe about the perils and pitfalls of the free market."&nbsp;He taps his jaw with the bulbous fountain pen.&nbsp;"And it's entirely funded by private individuals? There's no grant from the EC?"&nbsp;"That's right."&nbsp;"Who runs it?"&nbsp;"Nikolas Jarolmek. A Pole. His family have lived in Britain since the war."&nbsp;"And how did you get the job?"&nbsp;"Through the Guardian. I responded to an advertisement."&nbsp;"Against how many other candidates?"&nbsp;"I couldn't say. I was told about a hundred and fifty."&nbsp;"Could you describe an average day at the office?"&nbsp;"Broadly speaking, I act in an advisory capacity, either by speaking to people on the telephone and answering any questions they may have about setting up in business in the UK or by writing letters in response to written queries. I'm also responsible for editing our quarterly magazine, the Central European Business Review. That lists a number of crucial contact organizations that might prove useful to small businesses that are just starting out. It also gives details of tax arrangements in this country, language schools, that kind of thing."&nbsp;"I see. It would be helpful if you could send me a copy."&nbsp;"Of course."&nbsp;To explain why I am here.&nbsp;The interview was set up on the recommendation of a man I barely know, a retired diplomat named Michael Hawkes. Six weeks ago I was staying at my mother's house in Somerset for the weekend, and he came to dinner. He was, she informed me, an old university friend of my father's.&nbsp;Until that night I had never met Hawkes, had never heard my mother mention his name. She said that he had spent a lot of time with her and Dad when they were first married in the 1960s. But when the Foreign Office posted him to Moscow, the three of them had lost touch. All this was before I was born.&nbsp;Hawkes retired from the Diplomatic Service earlier this year to take up a directorship at a British oil company called Abnex. I don't know how Mum tracked down his phone number, but he showed up for dinner alone, no wife, on the stroke of eight o'clock.&nbsp;There were other guests there that night, bankers and insurance brokers in bulletproof tweeds, but Hawkes was a thing apart. He had a blue silk cravat slung around his neck like a noose and a pair of velvet loafers embroidered on the toe with an elaborate coat of arms. There was nothing ostentatiously debonair about any of this, nothing vain; it just looked as if he hadn't taken them off in twenty years. He was wearing a washed-out blue shirt with fraying collar and cuffs and stained silver cuff links that looked as though they had been in his family since the Opium Wars. In short, we got on. We sat next to each other at dinner and talked for close on three hours about everything from politics to infidelity. Three days after the party my mother told me that she had spotted Hawkes in her local supermarket, stocking up on Stolichnaya and tomato juice. Almost immediately, like a task, he asked her if I had ever thought of "going in for the Foreign Office." My mother said that she didn't know.&nbsp;"Ask him to give me a ring if he's interested."&nbsp;So on the telephone that night my mother did what mothers are supposed to do.&nbsp;"You remember Michael, who came to dinner?"&nbsp;"Yes," I said, stubbing out a cigarette.&nbsp;"He likes you. Thinks you should try out for the Foreign Office."&nbsp;"He does?"&nbsp;"What an opportunity, Alec. To serve Queen and Country."&nbsp;I nearly laughed at this, but checked it out of respect for her old-fashioned convictions.&nbsp;"Mum," I said, "an ambassador is an honest man sent abroad to lie for the good of his country."&nbsp;She sounded impressed.&nbsp;"Who said that?"&nbsp;"I don't know."&nbsp;"Anyway, Michael says to give him a ring if you're interested. I've got the number. Fetch a pen."&nbsp;I tried to stop her. I didn't like the idea of her putting shape on my life, but she was insistent.&nbsp;"Not everyone gets a chance like this. You're twenty-four now. You've only got that small amount of money your father left you in his Paris account. It's time you started thinking about a career and stopped working for that crooked Pole."&nbsp;I argued with her a little more, just enough to convince myself that if I went ahead it would be of my own volition and not because of some parental arrangement. Then, two days later, I rang Hawkes.&nbsp;It was shortly after nine o'clock in the morning. He answered after one ring, the voice crisp and alert.&nbsp;"Michael. It's Alec Milius."&nbsp;"Hello."&nbsp;"About the conversation you had with my mother."&nbsp;"Yes."&nbsp;"In the supermarket."&nbsp;"You want to go ahead?"&nbsp;"If that's possible. Yes."&nbsp;His manner was strangely abrupt. No friendly chat, no excess fat.&nbsp;"I'll talk to one of my colleagues. They'll be in touch."&nbsp;"Good. Thanks."&nbsp;Three days later a letter arrived in a plain white envelope marked private and confidential.&nbsp;Foreign and Commonwealth Office&nbsp;No. 46A------Terrace&nbsp;London SW1&nbsp;PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL&nbsp;Dear Mr. Milius,&nbsp;It has been suggested to me that you might be interested to have a discussion with us about fast-stream appointments in government service in the field of foreign affairs which occasionally arise in addition to those covered by the Open Competition to the Diplomatic Service.

The background of the tragedy is here: the history of bad blood and broken treaties between the Sioux Nation and the United States, the underlying reason for Custer's expedition and for the convocation of Indians on the Little Bighorn that particular year.

The Kindertransport was a rescue operation that saved 10,000 Jewish children from Nazi-occupied Europe between December 1938 and September 1939 and found homes for them in England. Only 1,000 of them ever saw their families again. Olga Levy Drucker's <i>Kindertransport</i> (1992) is one survivor's detailed story. The authors of this book were also<i> Kinder</i> who got away to England, and they have written a profoundly moving, accessible account that combines the history of the time with the first-person testimonies of 21 survivors. Each chapter begins with the big picture--life under Hitler, Kristallnacht, preparing to leave, the journey, life in England through the war years and afterward--and then includes brief vignettes by <i>Kinder </i>who remember how it was for them; finally, a brief note summarizes what happened to each child afterward. The design is like an open scrapbook, with different size typefaces, snapshots, news photos, and marginal notes; and the combination of the general overview with personal memories will bring readers, from middle grades through adult, close to the experience. These people escaped; the brutality is offstage, but the anguish is in the childhood details. What was it like to say good-bye to your parents, knowing you might never see them again? To arrive in a new country, learn a new language, and live with strangers? To discover after the war that your family was gone? Or to find your parents, leave your foster home, and try to be a family again? The authors' quiet final note is rooted in the survivors' stories: the <i>Kinder </i>have learned, among other things, to appreciate people's differences and to remember the kindness of strangers. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>God Against The Gods: The History of the War Between Monotheism and Polytheism</h2><p>"Lively... points out that the conflict between the worship of many gods and the worship of one true god never disappeared." &#x2014;<b>Publishers Weekly</b><p>"Jonathan Kirsch has written another blockbuster about the Bible and its world." &#x2014;<b>David Noel Freedman</b>, Editor-in-Chief of the Anchor Bible Project</p><p>"Kirsch tackles the central issue bedeviling the world today - religious intolerance...

He lectures and consults widely on biblical, literary, and legal topics and is a past president of PEN Center USA West.<p>Jonathan Kirsch is a fine storyteller with a flair for rendering ancient tales relevant and appealing to modern audiences. God Against the Gods finds him in good form, retelling lively stories about the struggle of monotheists against polytheists (and vice versa) from biblical times until the fourth century A.D. when Theodosius the Great outlawed pagan worship and made the Catholic version of monotheism the Roman Empire's state religion. Admirers of the author's earlier books, including Moses: A Life, King David and The Harlot by the Side of the Road, will find much to admire here. They may also be somewhat disconcerted by the theory that these stories are intended to exemplify.</p><p> In brief, Kirsch argues that monotheism -- the belief "that only a single deity is worthy of worship for the simple reason that only a single deity exists" -- is responsible for three millennia of religious intolerance and persecution, up to and including the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001 on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. Those events he terms "only the most recent example of the violence that men and women are inspired to commit against their fellow human beings by their true belief in the Only True God." By comparison with exclusivist monotheism, Kirsch thinks that tolerant polytheism gets a bad rap. "At the heart of polytheism is an open-minded and easygoing approach to religious belief and practice," he asserts, the opposite of monotheism's dangerous "tendency to regard one's own rituals and practices as the only proper way to worship the one true god."</p><p> The argument is problematic, but not entirely specious. There is a connection between the fourth-century Christian extremists who destroyed the Serapeum, the most beautiful pagan temple in Alexandria, and the 20th-century Muslim extremists who blew up irreplaceable Buddhist statues in Afghanistan. But what connects these events is a certain kind of violent rigorism, not monotheism itself. The author seems to think that one thing leads naturally to another (thus, the alleged "tendency" of monotheists to become brutally intolerant) -- but this begs a vital question. Some monotheists brand people who do not share their particular beliefs evil and seek to destroy them. Others are inspired by the idea of one God to conceive of one human family, related by ties of love and responsibility. The unasked question is this: Under what circumstances do we get one form of monotheism rather than the other? What makes Torquemada Torquemada, and Pope John XXIII John XXIII?</p><p> The question is difficult, but it requires an answer. Avoiding it makes it seem that beliefs alone cause violence, when it seems pretty clear that they do not -- that the behavior of a figure like Theodosius the Great or Osama bin Laden cannot be explained on the basis of Roman Catholicism or Islamic Wahhabism alone. One needs to account not only for religious beliefs but for their context: the multiple social, political, and psychological factors that, linked with theological doctrines, incline a person to act either like a seeker of peace or a violent avenger. Kirsch's tales -- especially the late-Roman stories of Constantine the Great and Julian, called "the Apostate" -- are well researched and well told, but one searches in vain for the contextual analysis that might explain Constantine's attempt to impose an orthodox Trinitarian doctrine on the Church or Julian's quixotic effort to revivify the fading Olympian deities. </p><p>Choosing not to focus on such questions produces another problem, as well: It weakens the historical argument in the same way that not looking at "uncomfortable" cases can weaken a legal brief. God Against the Gods offers very little information about tolerant or universalist monotheists; and when it comes to the polytheists, the author tends to explain any intolerance away. (For example: "Whether the gruesome accounts of Christian martyrdom are works of history or works of propaganda . . . is still an open question.") Kirsch is no doubt right to condemn the smear tactics that early Christian apologists used against the "pagans," which involved accusing them unjustly of engaging in ritual orgies, child sacrifice and the stupidest sort of idolatry (i.e., confusing the representation of a god with the god himself). Even so, he tends to identify polytheism with the most civilized traditions of the ancient world while focusing on monotheism at its most uncivilized.</p><p> All this being said, Kirsch has written a highly readable book about a topic well worth pondering. My advice to the reader is to put his theory aside in order to concentrate on the stories themselves, which point to a richer, more complex reality. For example, Kirsch notes that by the third and fourth centuries A.D. many nominal polytheists in Rome and Greece were proclaiming their belief in a single, omnipotent Supreme Being. Constantine himself went from the worship of Sol Invictus, the Unconquered Sun, to Christian worship of the One God, which was ritually solemnized on Sun-day. Similarly, as the great historian of late antiquity Peter Brown has observed, late Roman attitudes toward sex and the family were changing in what might seem a "Christian" direction even before Christianity had become a major force for change in the Empire.</p><p> And what of the Arian/Trinitarian controversies of the same period, which involved attempts by Christian leaders to account for the multiple nature of their unitary God? Despite the differences between monotheists and polytheists, it appears that there were social forces impelling both sets of believers to move in similar directions. It is a pity that Kirsch fails to shed more light on the relationship between religious beliefs and their social context. Doing so might help us identify the forces that continue to drive some people to kill in the name of God. </p><p></p><p>Reviewed by Richard E.

William Safire, the author of the <em>New York Times</em> Magazine column "On Language," homes in on the "essential misrules of grammar," those mistakes that call attention to the major rules and regulations of writing. He tells you the correct way to write and then tells you when it is all right to break the rules. In this lighthearted guide, he chooses the most common and perplexing concerns of writers new and old. Each mini-chapter starts by stating a misrule like "Don't use Capital letters without good REASON." Safire then follows up with solid and entertaining advice on language, grammar, and life. He covers a vast territory from capitalization, split infinitives (it turns out you can split one if done meaningfully), run-on sentences, and semi-colons to contractions, the double negative, dangling participles, and even onomatopoeia. Originally published under the title <em>Fumblerules</em>.</p><p>William Safire (1929&#x2015;2009), a Pulitzer Prize-winner, was the long-time author of the "On Language" column in the New York Times Magazine.There are only so many ways to denounce the double negative, and Safire hasn't discovered a new one. This slim style guide rehashes that not uncommon mistake along with 49 other equally obvious bloopers, which Safire boils down to short phrases that both illustrate and encapsulate the rule; e.g., "no sentence fragments" and "don't use contractions." Much of the text feels recycled from Safire's weekly "On Language" columns in the <i>New York Times Magazine.</i> A section on onomatopoeia, for example, is little more than an excuse to recount the origins of "zap." Even with such meager content, the book is repetitious, attacking more than once "the pretentious use of dead words" and outdated slang, colloquialisms and dialect. Some passages, like an account of the debate over using "he" as a universal pronoun, are long past their sell-by date. That's probably the biggest problem with this would-be stylebook: the language mavens who are Safire's core audience will find it all overfamiliar, while graduating high school students, into whose hands the book will certainly fall, may regard the author's humor as terminally unhip. Strunk and White's no-nonsense <i>Elements of Style</i> remains the young writer's best bet.<i> (July)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

But by the year 2150 big predators may only exist on the other side of glass barriers and chain-link fences. Their gradual disappearance is changing the very nature of our existence. We no longer occupy an intermediate position on the food chain; instead we survey it invulnerably from above&#x2015;so far above that we are in danger of forgetting that we even belong to an ecosystem.</p><p>Casting his expert eye over the rapidly diminishing areas of wilderness where predators still reign, the award-winning author of <em>The Song of the Dodo</em> and <em>The Tangled Tree</em> examines the fate of lions in India's Gir forest, of saltwater crocodiles in northern Australia, of brown bears in the mountains of Romania, and of Siberian tigers in the Russian Far East. In the poignant and troublesome ferocity of these embattled creatures, we recognize something primeval deep within us, something in danger of vanishing forever.</p></p><p>As the subtitle of David Quammen's <i>Monster of God: The Man-Eating Predator in the Jungles of History and the Mind</i> suggests, his fascination centers on those animals that raise human "awareness of being meat," and he likens the historic impact of these predators to modern-day car accidents: sudden, unexpected, life-changing. While his research is extraordinary--encompassing extensive field work and diverse reading on the science and lore surrounding predatory animals--Quammen's peripatetic mind jumps from history to psychology to ecology and from Africa to Russia to Australia, sometimes leaving his readers without a base camp to recuperate during the breath-taking journey. <p> His research on the lions of Gir forest in India, on the crocodiles of Northern Australia, on the bears of the Carpathian Mountains in Romania, and on the Siberian tigers of Far East Russia finds animals held in constant tension, encircled by every-expanding human populations. But Quammen doesn't oversimplify the conflicts. Often, in fact, Quammen has so much to say about competing interests that he makes several false starts before finding his true theme. Recalling his reading in the l970s literature on crocodiles in Africa, for example, Quammen abruptly jumps to a failed farming and reintroduction project begun in India before finally settling into the investigation of Northern Australia's Crocodylus Park. </p> <p> These changes in geography, time, and perspective can be disorienting in a book that is already complicated by its several competing approaches. Adding to the abundance, Quammen explores human population growth projections, images of the Leviathan in the Bible, keystone species theory, the Muskrat hypothesis (the idea that the "wastage parts" of an animal species are the ones most likely to suffer predation), and the 1994 discovery of the Chauvet cave paintings. Yet Quammen, author of <i>The Soing of the Dodo</i> moves with such ease through this wilderness of ideas that even the most difficult material becomes palatable. <i>--Patrick O�Kelley</i></p>David Quammen is the author of The Song of the Dodo, among other books.

The public first learned of it in February, when a vast series of raids and arrests occurred, followed by the deliberate burning and dynamiting--under suitable precautions--of an enormous number of crumbling, worm-eaten, and supposedly empty houses along the abandoned waterfront. Uninquiring souls let this occurrence pass as one of the major clashes in a spasmodic war on liquor.<br><br>Keener news-followers, however, wondered at the prodigious number of arrests, the abnormally large force of men used in making them, and the secrecy surrounding the disposal of the prisoners. No trials, or even definite charges, were reported; nor were any of the captives seen thereafter in the regular gaols of the nation. There were vague statements about disease and concentration camps, and later about dispersal in various naval and military prisons, but nothing positive ever developed. Innsmouth itself was left almost depopulated, and is even now only beginning to show signs of a sluggishly revived existence.<br><br>Complaints from many liberal organisations were met with long confidential discussions, and representatives were taken on trips to certain camps and prisons. As a result, these societies became surprisingly passive and reticent. Newspaper men were harder to manage, but seemed largely to cooperate with the government in the end. Only one paper--a tabloid always discounted because of its wild policy--mentioned the deep-diving submarine that discharged torpedoes downward in the marine abyss just beyond Devil Reef. That item, gathered by chance in a haunt of sailors, seemed indeed rather far-fetched; since the low, black reef lies a full mile and a half out from Innsmouth Harbour.<br><br>People around the county and in the nearby towns muttered a great deal among themselves, but said very little to the outer world. They had talked about dying and half-deserted Innsmouth for nearly a century, and nothing new could be wilder or more hideous than what they had whispered and hinted years before. Many things had taught them secretiveness, and there was now no need to exert pressure on them. Besides, they really knew very little; for wide salt marshes, desolate and unpeopled, keep neighbours off from Innsmouth on the landward side.<br><br>But at last I am going to defy the ban on speech about this thing. Results, I am certain, are so thorough that no public harm save a shock of repulsion could ever accrue from a hinting of what was found by those horrified raiders at Innsmouth. Besides, what was found might possibly have more than one explanation. I do not know just how much of the whole tale has been told even to me, and I have many reasons for not wishing to probe deeper. For my contact with this affair has been closer than that of any other layman, and I have carried away impressions which are yet to drive me to drastic measures.<br><br>It was I who fled frantically out of Innsmouth in the early morning hours of July 16, 1927, and whose frightened appeals for government inquiry and action brought on the whole reported episode. I was willing enough to stay mute while the affair was fresh and uncertain; but now that it is an old story, with public interest and curiosity gone, I have an odd craving to whisper about those few frightful hours in that ill-rumoured and evilly shadowed seaport of death and blasphemous abnormality. The mere telling helps me to restore confidence in my own faculties; to reassure myself that I was not simply the first to succumb to a contagious nightmare hallucination. It helps me, too, in making up my mind regarding a certain terrible step which lies ahead of me.<br><br>I never heard of Innsmouth till the day before I saw it for the first and--so far--last time. I was celebrating my coming of age by a tour of New England--sightseeing, antiquarian, and genealogical--and had planned to go directly from ancient Newburyport to Arkham, whence my mother's family was derived. I had no car, but was travelling by train, trolley, and motor-coach, always seeking the cheapest possible route. In Newburyport they told me that the steam train was the thing to take to Arkham; and it was only at the station ticket-office, when I demurred at the high fare, that I learned about Innsmouth. The stout, shrewd-faced agent, whose speech showed him to be no local man, seemed sympathetic toward my efforts at economy, and made a suggestion that none of my other informants had offered.<br><br>"You could take that old bus, I suppose," he said with a certain hesitation, "but it ain't thought much of hereabouts. It goes through Innsmouth--you may have heard about that--and so the people don't like it. Run by an Innsmouth fellow--Joe Sargent--but never gets any custom from here, or Arkham either, I guess. Wonder it keeps running at all. I s'pose it's cheap enough, but I never see more'n two or three people in it--nobody but those Innsmouth folks. Leaves the Square--front of Hammond's Drug Store--at 10 a.m. and 7 p.m. unless they've changed lately. Looks like a terrible rattletrap--I've never ben on it."<br><br>That was the first I ever heard of shadowed Innsmouth. Any reference to a town not shown on common maps or listed in recent guide-books would have interested me, and the agent's odd manner of allusion roused something like real curiosity. A town able to inspire such dislike in its neighbours, I thought, must be at least rather unusual, and worthy of a tourist's attention. If it came before Arkham I would stop off there--and so I asked the agent to tell me something about it. He was very deliberate, and spoke with an air of feeling slightly superior to what he said.<br><br>"Innsmouth? Well, it's a queer kind of a town down at the mouth of the Manuxet. Used to be almost a city--quite a port before the War of 1812--but all gone to pieces in the last hundred years or so. No railroad now--B. and M. never went through, and the branch line from Rowley was given up years ago.<br><br>"More empty houses than there are people, I guess, and no business to speak of except fishing and lobstering. Everybody trades mostly either here or in Arkham or Ipswich. Once they had quite a few mills, but nothing's left now except one gold refinery running on the leanest kind of part-time.<br><br>"That refinery, though, used to be a big thing, and Old Man Marsh, who owns it, must be richer'n Croesus. Queer old duck, though, and sticks mighty close in his home. He's supposed to have developed some skin disease or deformity late in life that makes him keep out of sight. Grandson of Captain Obed Marsh, who founded the business. His mother seems to've ben some kind of foreigner--they say a South Sea islander--so everybody raised Cain when he married an Ipswich girl fifty years ago. They always do that about Innsmouth people, and folks here and hereabouts always try to cover up any Innsmouth blood they have in 'em. But Marsh's children and grandchildren look just like anyone else so far's I can see. I've had 'em pointed out to me here--though, come to think of it, the elder children don't seem to be around lately. Never saw the old man.<br><br>"And why is everybody so down on Innsmouth? Well, young fellow, you mustn't take too much stock in what people around here say. They're hard to get started, but once they do get started they never let up. They've ben telling things about Innsmouth--whispering 'em, mostly--for the last hundred years, I guess, and I gather they're more scared than anything else. Some of the stories would make you laugh--about old Captain Marsh driving bargains with the devil and bringing imps out of hell to live in Innsmouth, or about some kind of devil-worship and awful sacrifices in some place near the wharves that people stumbled on around 1845 or thereabouts--but I come from Panton, Vermont, and that kind of story don't go down with me.<br><br>"You ought to hear, though, what some of the old-timers tell about the black reef off the coast--Devil Reef, they call it. It's well above water a good part of the time, and never much below it, but at that you could hardly call it an island. The story is that there's a whole legion of devils seen sometimes on that reef--sprawled about, or darting in and out of some kind of caves near the top. It's a rugged, uneven thing, a good bit over a mile out, and toward the end of shipping days sailors used to make big detours just to avoid it.<br><br>"That is, sailors that didn't hail from Innsmouth. One of the things they had against old Captain Marsh was that he was supposed to land on it sometimes at night when the tide was right. Maybe he did, for I dare say the rock formation was interesting, and it's just barely possible he was looking for pirate loot and maybe finding it; but there was talk of his dealing with demons there. Fact is, I guess on the whole it was really the Captain that gave the bad reputation to the reef.<br><br>"That was before the big epidemic of 1846, when over half the folks in Innsmouth was carried off. They never did quite figure out what the trouble was, but it was probably some foreign kind of disease brought from China or somewhere by the shipping. It surely was bad enough--there was riots over it, and all sorts of ghastly doings that I don't believe ever got outside of town--and it left the place in awful shape. Never came back--there can't be more'n 300 or 400 people living there now.<br><br>"But the real thing behind the way folks feel is simply race prejudice--and I don't say I'm blaming those that hold it. I hate those Innsmouth folks myself, and I wouldn't care to go to their town. I<br><br>s'pose you know--though I can see you're a Westerner by your talk--what a lot our New England ships used to have to do with queer ports in Africa, Asia, the South Seas, and everywhere else, and what queer kinds of people they sometimes brought back with 'em. You've probably heard about the Salem man that came home with a Chinese wife, and maybe you know there's still a bunch o...</p><h2>The Dry Grass of August</h2><p><b>[This is the Audiobook CASSETTE Library Edition in vinyl case.]</b><br><br> In this beautifully written debut, Anna Jean Mayhew offers a riveting depiction of Southern life in the throes of segregation and what it will mean for a young girl on her way to adulthood and for the woman who means the world to her.<br><br> On a scorching day in August 1954, thirteen-year-old Jubie Watts leaves Charlotte, North Carolina, with her family for a Florida vacation.

What made you decide to write a novel at this age?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Actually, I didn't get such a late start; my first national publication was a short story when I was forty-five. That was so thrilling that I decided maybe this writing business was something I should take seriously. Then life happened and it was another two years before I wrote the first paragraph--in 1987--of what became <em>The Dry Grass of August</em>. I joined a group of accomplished writers and quickly realized that I had a lot to learn and that a novel was not something I could dash off while working full time. Eighteen years later I finished it and got a fine agent right away. When he sold it to Kensington, I was almost seventy.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> You grew up during the time of Jim Crow laws in the South. What happened in that time that spurred you to write this novel?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> As a teenager I was aware that I lived in an all-white, mostly Protestant community. But my real consciousness did not start until 1970 (sixteen years after the 1954 decision in <em>Brown v. Board</em>), when forced busing went into effect and my fourth- and fifth-grade children were assigned to an inner-city school. Compared with the nice white elementary a block from our house, the conditions at the formerly all-black school were abysmal, a graphic example of the inequity of the doctrine of separate but equal. I became long-time friends with a young mother of two who was living a life similar to mine, except that I was white and she was black. One summer afternoon in 1972 we took our children to a public swimming pool in Cabarrus County, NC. The owner of the pool stopped us at the gate and said he would close the place down before he'd admit my friend and her children. Almost two decades after the official overturning of Jim Crow laws, social segregation was alive and well.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Your two main characters are 13-year-old Jubie, a white teenager, and 47-year-old Mary, a black domestic. As you wrote the book, was it hard to get inside two such different characters?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Yes, at first I had great difficulty capturing Mary's spirit, given how invisible she is in her role as a "colored maid" in a white upper-class southern home. Over time her moral character, her strength, and her commitment to Jubie emerged. In Chapter Six, she's been working for the family a year or so, and Jubie is beginning to be aware of what a difference Mary makes to the peace in the home. That's when I began to see those things myself and to realize Mary's true importance to the family. Jubie matured as I wrote the book; at first I had her as being quite innocent, emotionally younger than her actual age. I began to pay close attention to 13-year-old girls, to really listen to them. Jubie turned out to be far more mature and much wiser than my initial conception of her. Her wisdom and curiosity surfaced when I let her have her head.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> In an early critique someone told you that Mary Luther comes across as a female Uncle Tom. What was your reaction to that?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> An African American teenager made that comment. I was grateful when she agreed to read the manuscript, and taken aback when she said that she didn't like or believe in the character of Mary, who she saw as a female Uncle Tom. But when I got to thinking about it, I realized that my young friend--born in 1989--had no frame of reference for Mary's timidity around whites, for the way she won't look a white person in the eye, and for the way she nods and says, "Yes, ma'am" and "Yes, sir." Ultimately I was pleased by my teenaged friend's observation. Her comment confirmed that I had succeeded in capturing the realities of Mary's life as a black domestic in the South in the mid-1950s.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Do you believe in the possibility of a positive future for William Watts, Jubie's father, a hope that he can make a new life for himself?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> I do. I might not have felt so strongly when I was younger, but I've seen many people turn their lives around. And in his last scene with Jubie, he is genuinely contrite; he admits that he's been wrong. But I temper my response: he can make a new life for himself if he's willing to question his attitudes and preconceptions, and to grapple, finally, with his alcoholism.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Out-takes are a favorite feature of movie-goers. Are there out-takes from your novel, scenes or characters that didn't make the final version?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> My penultimate manuscript was 94,000 words long. The book in print is 74,000 words. I cut several chapters after my writing group persuaded me that while those sections were entertaining, well written, delicious and delightful, they did not deepen the characters or further the plot. I cried, then cut them. In one such chapter--about fifteen pages--Jubie visits Meemaw and the old woman tries to teach her deportment. The lessons, though futile, were quite funny. I love to make people laugh, so cutting that chapter was painful for me. Linda Gibson, the buxom grass widow who lives next door to the Watts family, was at one time much more fleshed out--so to speak--than she is in the final. Jubie's cousin Sarah had a younger brother who just had to go, because he didn't carry his weight. Most of the cuts were made after I thought I'd finished the book.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Two characters appear briefly in Chapter 23, Mr. and Mrs. Ezra Travis, a black attorney and his wife. They are atypical, not what readers might expect in a book set in the South in 1954. Why did you include that couple?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Most of the people of color in my book are working class, poorly educated. But of course there were black professionals like the Travises in the mid-fifties South. Also I wanted Jubie to be with someone strongly sympathetic when she heard the news about Mary. One almost eerie thing: I had already named Ezra Travis when I learned that his given name means "helper" and his surname means "from the crossroads."</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> At the book's end in January of 1955, Paula Watts, Jubie's mother, is a forty-something mother of four, who will soon be divorced. Where do you imagine she'll be in fifteen years when her children have left home?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Paula was an enigma to me for most of the book, especially in Chapter 19, when she seems to sell herself back to Bill for a bottle of perfume. But after awhile I realized that she'd become weary of the enmity between her and Bill, and that forgiving his infidelity was simply easier than continuing to be angry and self-righteous. Paula is the character who changes the most in the course of the novel. When it's clear that Bill is out of her life, she squares her shoulders, gets a job, snaps out of her deep depression, and finally becomes the parent her children need. Maybe she'll re-marry, maybe she won't, but regardless, she'll never again let anyone tell her how to live. I'd like to think she'll be much less concerned about appearances.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> Jubie suffered serious abuse as a child. What sort of future do you imagine for her?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> Jubie's a survivor. It might take her some time, but she'll make a good life for herself. She will be okay and she'll never forget Mary or Leesum.</p> <p><strong>Q:</strong> What can you tell us about your next novel?</p> <p><strong>A:</strong> It's set in 1970, fifteen years after <em>Dry Grass</em>, during the first year of public school integration in Charlotte, at a time when the city was involved in urban renewal, clearing out of inner-city neighborhoods that occupied valuable land. Two characters are talking to me now, and I'm writing down what they say. Their paths will cross. Things will happen. In a couple of years you can buy the book and we'll both know what it's about.</p><i>The Dry Grass of August</i>&nbsp;is Anna Jean Mayhew's first published work of fiction.&nbsp; She presently resides just outside of the Raleigh-Durham, NC area.</p><h2>The Imagineering Field Guide to Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World (An Imagineering Field Guide)</h2><p>The first in a series of pocket-sized paperbacks will answer the question, &#34;What would it be like to walk through the Disney Theme Parks with an Imagineer by your side?&#34; The Imagineering Field Guide to The Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World provides that experience: pointing out details and telling stories, back stories, and Imagineering insights never before heard, condensed into a portable, easily-referenced park guide.

The first book to capture the flavor and spirit of the Talmud as a human document and to summarize its main principles as an expression of divine law.</p><p>The Talmud is a repository of thousands of years of Jewish wisdom. Its two-and-a-half million words consist of a conglomeration of law, legend, and philosophy, a blend of unique logic, shrewd pragmatism, history, science, anecdotes, and humor. In The Essential Talmud, Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz, regarded as one of the leading rabbis of the century, offers an introduction to this sacred Jewish text, clearly and brilliantly describing the beliefs, attitudes, and methods that have occupied students of the Talmud for centuries. If the Bible is the cornerstone of Judaism&#34;, writes Rabbi Steinsaltz, &#34;then the Talmud is the central pillar, soaring up from the foundations and supporting the entire spiritual and intellectual edifice&#34;. The Talmud, though in many ways the most important book in Jewish culture, is a work with which most Jews are almost entirely unfamiliar. Rabbi Steinsaltz, whose life&#39;s work includes his efforts to revive the study of the Talmud among the Jewish people, observes that &#34;a Jewish society that ceases to study the Talmud has no real hope of survival&#34;. Describing the Talmud as &#34;the backbone of creativity and national life&#34; for Jews, Rabbi Steinsaltz explains that &#34;understanding the Talmud gives one a key, not only for itself, but for all Jewish culture&#34;. He goes on to state that &#34;from a cultural perspective the Talmud is the tool for self-understanding&#34; for the Jewish people. Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz has a remarkable encyclopedic knowledge of Torah, Halakhah (Jewish law), and. Kabbalah (Jewish mystical thought), as well as a mastery of the sciences. He has earned worldwide recognition as a scholar, teacher, and mentor. The Essential Talmud, like several other works by RabbiSteinsaltz, has become a modern Jewish classic. His own Talmud translation and commentary, a project that Rabbi Steinsaltz began in 1967, has received extraordinary praise, and tens of thousands of volumes of his Talmud edition are circulating. The Essential Talmud is a superb window through which we can gain a glimpse, and more, of perhaps the most unique sacred work in the history of religion. In a single brief volume, Rabbi Steinsaltz succeeds in capturing the flavor and spirit of the Talmud as a human document and at the same time summarizes its main principles as an expression of divine law. A work of profound scholarship and yet also of concise, simple, and brilliant pedagogy, The Essential Talmud will make equally enlightening reading for those who are already versed in the subject and those who come to it for the first time.<b>Rabbi Adin Steinsaltz</b> is internationally regarded as one of the leading scholars and rabbis of this century. His education includes a degree in mathematics from Hebrew University, in addition to his rabbinic studies. Rabbi Steinsaltz founded the Israel Institute for Talmudic Publications; under its aegis, he has published fifty-eight books on the Talmud, Jewish mysticism, religious thought, sociology, historical biography, and philosophy. His biography of the famed Rabbi Menachem Schneerson will be published in 2007. These books have been translated into Russian, English, French, Portuguese, Swedish, Japanese, and Dutch. He lives in Jerusalem.</p><h2>Moo</h2><p>"DELECTABLY ENTERTAINING. . . .

As a matter of fact I suffer from the exact opposite of stage fright. I suffer from the fear of not getting on stage, of not grabbing the spotlight, of letting a potentially magical moment slip by. I&#x2019;m not sure what drives it, nor am I sure how to control it, all I know is that I will give a three count of noble &#x201c;<i>no&#x2019;s</i>&#x201d; before I risk making a complete ass out of myself.</p> <p>&#x201c;Bert, you should get up there and say something!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <i>One.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Seriously, the mic is open.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s a bad idea.&#x201d; <i>Two.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;It would be hilarious&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; <i>Three.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah&#x2026;&#x201d;</p> <p>And I&#x2019;m off. There have been some beauties and some beasts (more often than not beasts). And it&#x2019;s those ugly ones that are generally remembered the longest.</p> <p>But there have been a handful of beauties, too.&#x2026; </p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>One of my earliest recollections is entering first grade. I had a very hard time with separation anxiety my first week. I&#x2019;d previously gone to a school where my mom taught and my sister attended, so I don&#x2019;t think I had a firm grasp of what entering first grade entailed&#x2014;the inherent gravity of it. It dawned on me when I got in my dad&#x2019;s van that morning, and we left for school&#x2014;alone. As we merged onto the interstate and into traffic, I felt my stomach swirl. I was in the system. My dad, like everyone else on the road, was thinking about the traffic. But for me, the fact that I was alone with my dad felt odd. We hadn&#x2019;t spent a lot of time alone up until then. I was still too young, and he was working a lot.</p> <p>He must have noticed my unease, because halfway to school he asked me what was going on.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nothing.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Do you think it would be okay for you not to go to work today and maybe hang out with me at my new school?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll hang out for a while, but I&#x2019;m going to have to go to work at some point.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Maybe you could just skip work and hang out, like, outside the classroom.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I think they have rules against that, buddy.&#x201d;</p> <p>We went back and forth like this all the way to my new school, up the stairs, and into my classroom, where I began to melt down. This is the parenting job my dad pulled on me:</p> <p>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the deal: I won&#x2019;t go anywhere. I will sit in the parking lot all day in my van until you&#x2019;re done with school. If you need me, just come out to the parking lot and get me.&#x201d;</p> <p>And I believed him&#x2014;for the first ten minutes of first grade. It was then that I politely informed my teacher, Mrs. Thompson, that I would be taking a little break from the introductory portion of today&#x2019;s lesson and heading out to the parking lot. I explained that I had just about had my fill of being without my family and needed to find my dad, who had promised to wait in his van in case such a situation were to arise. She explained in her soft Southern accent that my dad had gone to work. He was not in the parking lot. I was going nowhere.</p> <p>To say I took this news poorly is like saying DMX has some bumps on his driving record.</p> <p>Tears turned into sobs, which turned into panic, which turned into sheer panic, which turned into mayhem. I made my way from desk to desk, from kid to kid, explaining that we might never see our parents again. Mrs. Thompson had lost control, and her only hope was to get me on her side to help calm the kids down. So we made a pact: I would do first grade peacefully, as long as I got to sit at the front of the class, my desk next to her, holding her hand.</p> <p>What can I tell you, I&#x2019;m a straight-up gangster.</p> <p>That year I discovered the band KISS, and with that discovery, found my life&#x2019;s direction. Whenever I could, I dressed in as much drag as I could pull together from my mom&#x2019;s closet, threw on as much makeup as I could sneak, and performed solo renditions, earphones on, in our living room. &#x201c;Shout It Out Loud&#x201d; was my preferred jam, although &#x201c;Rock And Roll All Nite&#x201d; inspired some stellar solo performances.</p> <p>A couple of my uncles were living with us at the time, trying to start a band, and they would go wild with laughter at my one-man show, which I couldn&#x2019;t hear (due to the headphones). They would suggest dance moves, wardrobe choices, and mock guitar licks, for my benefit and their amusement. I jumped at the coaching, following their direction to a T. Come Christmas, I was a goddamned air-guitaring Jimi Hendrix.</p> <p>So you can imagine the excitement that overwhelmed me when I first caught wind of our elementary-school talent show. Finally, all my training could be put to use. I almost felt bad for the kids who had to muster together some kind of performance in a matter of weeks, while I had been in rehearsals since August. I kept a lid on my project, though, and practiced even more dutifully than before. I listened more closely to my uncles&#x2019; guidance, as they sipped their Heinekens. I kept my eye on the prize.</p> <p>Come talent-show morning I was ready. I told my mom the night before that I had entered and would need to borrow some of her clothes. My mom, hands down the most supportive woman I know, didn&#x2019;t offer the least resistance. She dressed me to the nines. I would handle my own hair and makeup. My mom walked me through what to put on and how to apply it. (I had to pretend that I hadn&#x2019;t been putting on her makeup in secret for months.)</p> <p>I met my dad at the front door for school that morning shirtless, in my mom&#x2019;s panty hose, with chains draped across my chest, cowboy boots, a cape, and a tote bag full of product.</p> <p>My dad blinked. &#x201c;What the fuck is this?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I have a talent show today and this is my costume.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Does your mother know about this?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;She dressed me!&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Of course she did.&#x201d;</p> <p>After he conferred with my mom for a minute, we drove silently for twenty-five minutes to downtown Tampa. In hindsight, I imagine my dad acted with me the same way he would if he had to, say, give a transvestite a ride home. But at the time I thought nothing of it. I was already envisioning my future glory. As I got out of the car, my dad handed me a bag.</p> <p>&#x201c;I had your mom pack an extra set of clothes and your uniform just in case you&nbsp;&#x2026; got cold.&#x201d; I took the bag, thanked him, and was on my way. I could hardly wait for the reception I would get from my first-grade class.</p> <p>The school day went just fine, as I remember it. I distinctly remember not being nervous but excited. Funny, too, because now, as a professional performer, I always get nervous. But that day I was stone-cold confident: I was going to murder.</p> <p>Then, suddenly, it was time for the talent show. Mrs. Thompson allowed my classmate Brian Callahan and me to go to the bathroom to take care of my hair and makeup. Ten minutes later we were back, and I was Gene Simmons. The class circled me admiringly. I couldn&#x2019;t wait to see the looks on their faces after my performance. I&#x2019;d be a god.</p> <p>We left as a class for the auditorium, and I split off with Brian, who had now assumed the role of tour manager. We learned that I&#x2019;d be performing in the latter half of the show. So I settled in, waiting for my cue as Brian made his way back to sit with the class.</p> <p>The show consisted of a predictable assortment of gymnastics, piano, comedy, and juggling. It wasn&#x2019;t until about halfway through that I saw him. A fourth grader with a violin&#x2014;dressed as KISS lead guitarist Ace Frehley. My heart sank&#x2014;this kid had stolen my act. He walked up to me and nodded.</p> <p>&#x201c;Which one are you supposed to be?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Gene Simmons.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Nice. What are you going to do?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;&#x2018;Rock And Roll All Nite.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, what instrument are you going to play?&#x201d;</p> <p>I looked at him like he had started speaking in Swahili. &#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I told him.</p> <p>&#x201c;Nothing? What, are you&nbsp;&#x2026; just going to dance?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Kind of.&#x201d;</p> <p>He started laughing and walked away. It wasn&#x2019;t until I saw my act in this light that I realized how ill prepared I was for this <i>talent</i> show. I didn&#x2019;t really have a talent, per se. All these people were dazzling the masses with actual skills they possessed, had been working on, crafting. My only real talent, as I saw it, was that I liked KISS.</p> <p>Panic set in as I watched Ace Frehley take the stage. Just seeing his makeup was enough to set off the crowd. Great, my one sure bet and he just stole it. Ace then banged out a semirecognizable version of &#x201c;Shout It Out Loud.&#x201d; He closed with a mock guitar strum on his violin. The place went nuts.</p> <p>He passed me without a word as he left the stage, then went over to the other fourth graders and slapped them five (high fives weren&#x2019;t around yet). A couple of kids went on in between us and as they did, I felt the pressure mounting and my confidence wilting. I had no act, my costume looked ridiculous, my makeup was suspect. And I realized that I had somehow completely overlooked the &#x201c;hair&#x201d; portion of my hair-and-makeup routine.</p> <p>But there was no time to do anything about it. It was showtime. I had them start the music before my entrance, just as I would do with my uncles. But with no instrument to show for myself, the crowd was more confused than anything. I can only imagine they were trying to figure out what this mini drag queen had in store.</p> <p>It&#x2019;s moments like these that define a man&#x2014;when he must choose between risking major, public humiliation or admit that he&#x2019;s been outclassed. I took that moment to sprint and then slide onto my knees up to the very edge of the stage.</p> <p>I then proceeded to air-guitar the fuck out my song for the K-through-Five set.</p> <p>The build started at the back, the fifth graders who I&#x2019;m sure had been rolling their eyes at the kid with the violin. After all the pianos, violins, and jugglers, to then have a first grader crank a song they all knew and loved and get <i>weird as fuck</i> on their asses&#x2014;it must have been a treat. I jammed for the whole song. Students sang along with me as I belted out the lyrics as loud as I could.</p> <p>I don&#x2019;t remember too much of what followed. There was the looks on their faces. The sounds of their cheers. But mainly I remember the elation of having been on stage. When my parents picked me up at school, I wasn&#x2019;t the same kid who had been dropped off that morning. I didn&#x2019;t enter the talent show the next year, the year after that, or any other years at elementary school, but one thing was for sure: the bug of performing had bitten me.</p> <p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p> <p>They haven&#x2019;t all been beauties. For every beauty, there are a dozen beasts. Fast-forward to 1993, Florida State University.</p> <p>By this time in my life I had begun to make a name for myself as a Funny Guy. I would write comic songs on my guitar about our friends, I was quick with a joke or a comeback, and was the go-to dude when our fraternity needed to put together a sketch or a skit. People would introduce me as one of the funniest guys they knew, and every once in a while, someone would pull me aside and tell me in all seriousness that I should try my hand at being a comedian.</p> <p>It sounded beyond unattainable, so I stayed in my small circle, continuing to make my friends laugh. My fraternity was the one place I knew I could always draw an audience. There were a few times a year when all 180 of us would gather, and one of those was elections. Guys would prepare a speech, put on a coat and tie, draw up bullet points on poster paper, and go around the room trying to sway votes in their direction.</p> <p>The more ambitious among us saw this as an opportunity to grow, network, pad a resume. I found it an ideal time to mock those guys. You got ten minutes to win votes. These were my ten minutes to entertain, my first brushes with stand-up. The first year I sang a song, got huge laughs&#x2014;and lost. The second year, I gave a very sincere ten-minute speech, completely naked. At first I got laughs, then very uncomfortable eye contact as I strutted around the stage pretending not to be naked. My platform was, &#x201c;I have nothing to hide,&#x201d; and despite my command performance, I lost again.</p> <p>The third year I hadn&#x2019;t prepared anything when I saw that Josh Young was running uncontested for the position of Worthy Keeper of the Annals. I had been taking myself really seriously at the time. I was in a band, plotting a path away from Writer-Comedian and toward Brooding Artist. But old habits die hard. My bandmate, John Dacre, leaned over to me and whispered, &#x201c;Are you going to run against him?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No.&#x201d; <i>One.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Are you going to run at all?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d; <i>Two.</i></p> <p>&#x201c;Well, you can&#x2019;t let him run uncontested, you gotta go up there naked again.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;To be honest my stomach is kind of bothering me; if I did go up there, I would probably just shit all over the place.&#x201d; <i>Three.</i></p> <p>Having heard only the last half of the conversation, our bassist and John&#x2019;s best friend, Brent Brackin, chimed in. &#x201c;That would be hilarious! You have to do that!&#x201d;</p> <p>I looked to Dacre, waiting for somebody to back down, but his eyes had widened.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yeah, you&#x2019;re doing that!&#x201d;</p> <p>And just like that it was decided.</p> <p>The two stood up and, in unison, said, &#x201c;We nominate Bert Kreischer for the Worthy Keeper of the Annals.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Bert,&#x201d; our president said, &#x201c;do you accept?&#x201d;</p> <p>I reluctantly nodded. The three of us headed back to the bathroom to prepare for my speech.</p> <p>Worthy Keeper of the Annals, the unfortunately titled office I was running for, was fairly low on the ballot, which meant it came early&#x2014;and that we had very little time to plan anything. Lucky for us, the speech as we conceived it required very little preparation. I stripped nude, Brackin found a tie for me, and Dacre, in a moment of genius, pulled an empty pizza box out of the garbage. The president came back to the bathroom to see if we were ready. We were.</p> <p>We walked in toward the end of Josh&#x2019;s speech, for which he was wielding a laser pointer (brand-new technology for the early 1990s). He was in a suit and tie, and closed with something to the effect of, &#x201c;And that is why I think you should vote for me.&#x201d;</p> <p>Josh took a seat as Brackin walked into the room and began to speak on my behalf, the kind of endorsement every candidate was required to have.</p> <p>He started solemnly, &#x201c;Guys, as you know Bert can be something of a jokester, a prankster if you will. But ever since we started our band, I&#x2019;ve seen a very different side of him. And I think tonight, if you look past the Bert you have come to know, you, too, will see a different side of him. With that said, for the position of Worthy Keeper of the Annals, our brother, Bert Kreischer.&#x201d;</p> <p>Dacre discreetly slid the pizza box into place. I revealed myself to the crowd, wearing only a tie. Like last year, they went nuts. A little lightheartedness was welcome, in what had come to be very serious and sometimes unhealthy campaigning. I walked up to the pizza box, butt cheeks clenched, and waited for the crowd to calm down.</p> <p>&#x201c;I would like to show you all a very different side of me,&#x201d; I said, turning my back to the crowd, facing the previous year&#x2019;s council. The audience laughed at what they thought was a simple joke: my ass. But as I let go, I heard a gasp.</p> <p>It was the sound of the last breaths of fresh air in the room behind inhaled.</p> <p>The council, sitting at their designated table, seemed confused at first. I started peeing at their feet. (As we all learned that day, you can&#x2019;t go number two without a little number one.)</p> <p>The smell was absolutely atrocious. The room cleared out in a matter of seconds. People literally jumped out of the windows, piled out of every door, began violently dry-heaving. The council lost their minds and dem...</p></p><h2>El �ltimo h�roe del Olimpo (Percy Jackson y los dioses del Olimpo 5): Percy Jackson y los Dioses del Olimpo V (Spanish Edition)</h2><p>The half-bloods have been preparing for war with the Titans for a year even though they know the odds are against them.

Important as the accomplishments of these men and women were, the written records pertaining to them are scarce, ambiguous, and often conflicting, and those curious about the birthplace of the United States are left to turn to dramatic and often highly fictionalized reports. In <i>Jamestown, the Buried Truth,</i> William Kelso takes us literally to the soil where the Jamestown colony began, unearthing the James Fort and its contents to reveal fascinating evidence of the lives and deaths of the first settlers, of their endeavors and struggles, and of their relationships with the Virginia Indians. He offers up a lively but fact-based account, framed around a narrative of the archaeological team's exciting discoveries.</p> <p>Once thought to have been washed away by the James River, James Fort still retains much of its structure, including palisade walls, bulwarks, interior buildings, a well, a warehouse, and several pits, and more than 500,000 objects have been cataloged, half dating to the time of Queen Elizabeth and King James. Artifacts especially reflective of life at James Fort include an ivory compass, Cabasset helmets and breastplates, glass and copper beads and ornaments, ceramics, tools, religious icons, a pewter flagon, and personal items. Dr. Kelso and his team of archaeologists have discovered the lost burial of one of Jamestown's early leaders, presumed to be Captain Bartholomew Gosnold, and the remains of several other early settlers, including a young man who died of a musket ball wound. In addition, they've uncovered and analyzed the remains of the foundations of Jamestown's massive capitol building.</p> <p>Refuting the now decades-old stereotype that attributed the high mortality rate of the Jamestown settlers to their laziness and ineptitude, <i>Jamestown, the Buried Truth</i> produces a vivid picture of the settlement that is far more complex, incorporating the most recent archaeology to give Jamestown its rightful place in history and thus contributing to a broader understanding of the transatlantic world.</p><p></p></p><p><p>William M. Kelso is Head Archaeologist of the Jamestown Rediscovery Project.</p><p>The unearthing of Jamestown is truly the autopsy of America, an amazing dissection and reconstruction of four-hundred-year-old artifacts and human remains that reveal how the first settlers spent their days, how they lived and died, and what they accomplished and suffered. Without chief archaeologist William Kelso's almost mystical vision that the original site still existed and his persistence against all odds to unearth it, we would have little to rely on but legend to tell us how modern America began. <i>Jamestown: The Buried Truth</i> is brilliantly written, a story and adventure unlike any other that will forever change the way we think about what happened when John Smith and his brave followers sailed to Virginia in 1607 and established the first permanent English settlement.</p> (Patricia Cornwell)<br><br><p>The exciting story of a momentous archaeological project, told firsthand by the scholars who uncovered the real Jamestown&#x2015;the original fort from John Smith&#x2019;s day. Based on information derived from thousands of artifacts uncovered amid the graves and foundations of England&#x201a;s earliest permanent settlement in America, William M. Kelso&#x2019;s <i>Jamestown, the Buried Truth</i> tells the world what his team found&#x2015;and what it means. Their scholarship is impeccable, their maps and illustrations are magnificent, and their discoveries are amazing.</p> (Jon Kukla, author of <i>Mr. Jefferson&#x2019;s Women</i> and <i>A Wilderness So Immense: The Louisiana Purchase and the Destiny of America</i>)<br><br><p>Anticipating the four hundredth anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, Bill Kelso and APVA/Preservation Virginia began thirteen years ago the archaeological exploration of the site of England's first permanent settlement in North America. What Kelso and his team have found there since the first shovel was turned is nothing less than astounding. Evidence of everything that was built, abandoned, and then lost during Jamestown's first decades survived, literally inches beneath commemorative statues of John Smith and Pocahontas. It is clear that Kelso's discovery and excavation of James Fort is, by far, the most important archaeological event in the long and distinguished history of archaeology in Virginia and that its contributions to historical understanding of Jamestown are significant for early Virginia and for the history of the Atlantic world.</p> (Carter L. Hudgins, Hofer Distinguished Professor of Early American Culture, University of Mary Washington)</p><h2>Enemies of the Permanent Things: Observations of Abnormity in Literature and Politics</h2><p>In the 1960s, Russell Kirk lectured and debated on many college campuses, ably defending traditional ideas against various liberal and radical adversaries. Enemies of the Permanent Things, first published in 1969, is the most significant extended meditation on culture and politics to come out of the rough and tumble of those years. As such, it is an invaluable document, articulating the response of a critical witness to the radically anti-authoritarian turn taken by the intellectual elite in that destructive decade. Kirk defines &#x201c;the permanent things&#x201d; (a phrase borrowed from T. S. Eliot) as the unchanging norms of human nature. In a healthy society, Kirk argues, individuals will attempt to live by these permanent standards of moral action, and the laws of the land will give support to citizens as they make that attempt. Focusing on literature as well as on politics, Kirk sets forth and defends those inalterable truths of human life.</p><p>Russell Kirk (1918&#x2013;1994) is acknowledged as the founder of the intellectual conservative movement in modern America. From his family home in rural Michigan, Kirk sent forth a multitude of writings on political philosophy, literature, education, and history. His bibliography includes nearly 3,000 newspaper columns, hundreds of journal articles, and 26 books. Benjamin G. Lockerd is Professor of English at Grand Valley State University, where he has received the Alumni Association&#x2019;s Outstanding Educator Award. He is the author of Aethereal Rumours: T. S. Eliot&#x2019;s Physics and Poetics and The Sacred Marriage: Psychic Integration in &#x201c;The Faerie Queene,&#x201d; and the editor of T. S. Eliot and Christian Tradition. Lockerd has served as President of the T. S. Eliot Society and is a Senior Fellow of the Russell Kirk Center.<p>"Reading of great lives does something to make decent lives," writes Russell Kirk in <em>Enemies of the Permanent Things</em>, an unjustly neglected gem among his works. Herein the author offers a collection of accessible explications of philosophy and imagination interconnecting a series of pen portraits of key twentieth-century authors: J. R. R. Tolkien, Ray Bradbury, George Orwell, T. S. Eliot, Eric Voegelin, and many other upholders of normative thought and literature. Kirk skilfully demonstrates how their works stand at swords-point with the dreary "champions of decadence and deliquescence, the enemies of the permanent things" in modern letters. His invaluable distinction between norms and the too-often-misused word values is but one of the treasures to be found within this eminently quotable volume. <strong>~James E. Person Jr., author of <em>Russell Kirk: A Critical Biography of a Conservative Mind</em> (1999)</strong></p> <p>"<em>In Enemies of the Permanent Things</em>, Russell Kirk, redoubtable champion of the &#x201c;moral imagination,&#x201d; challenges the nihilists who contend that morality is relative, that human nature is merely &#x201c;socially constructed,&#x201d; and that western civilization is but the flawed product of a ceaseless will to power. Drawing upon his prodigious knowledge of arts, letters, and political philosophy, he excoriates modern ideologues who strive to impose a heaven of their own devising on earth and open instead the gates to a tyrannical hell. For Kirk the road to cultural renewal lies in preserving the core of western civilization: Christianity ("including its origins in Judah and Israel"), &#x201c;ordered liberty,&#x201d; and the canonical books of western literature. In <em>Enemies</em> he persuasively argues that the supreme purpose of great literature is ethical: the formation of &#x201c;normative consciousness&#x201d; and transmission of &#x201c;normative knowledge&#x201d; essential to civilized living. Kirk&#x2019;s book was both wise and timely when published nearly fifty years ago. It is still wise&#x2014;and even more timely&#x2014;now." <strong>~George H. Nash, author of <em>The Conservative Intellectual Movement in America Since 1945</em> and other books</strong></p></p><h2>Cowboys &amp; the Trappings of the Old West</h2><p>Cowboys &amp; the Trappings of the Old West is a pictorial celebration of the old time buckaroo.

She is the author of <i>Good Dog, Carl</i> and the rest of the beloved Carl books, including <i>Carl Goes Shopping</i>, <i>Carl&#x2019;s Christmas</i>, <i>Carl&#x2019;s Birthday</i> and <i>Carl&#x2019;s Snowy Afternoon</i>. Darling was born in 1941 in Cincinnati, Ohio, to a large and close-knit family. Painting was a popular family recreation, and almost every family excursion included one or more easels and a variety of sketch pads, chalks, paints, and pencils. For four years, the family lived on a hundred-acre farm in Kentucky. Here young Sandra grew especially fond of riding and training horses, and became a dog owner for the first time. Living in the country also provided plenty of time for reading, a life-long passion. &nbsp;Sandra illustrated her first book in 1983: <i>The Teddy Bears' Picnic</i>, a popular children's song by Jimmy Kennedy. That same year, she was visiting Zurich, Switzerland, when she came across a volume of old German picture sheets, one of which featured a poodle playing with a baby who was supposed to be taking a nap. This image proved the inspiration for <i>Good Dog, Carl</i>. The Darlings' own dog, a Rottweiler named Toby, was the model for the book's main character. Since then, two other Darling Rottweilers have posed as Carl in the seven sequels: the late Arambarri, who was named for one of the Darlings' favorite jai alai players; and Zabala, who currently moonlights as an Our Best Friend therapy dog, visiting hospitals to cheer patients. &nbsp;About her work Sandra says: "I think that one of the reasons my illustrations have appealed to people is that they can sense my sincerity. I know that marvels exist which are just outside our ordinary experience, but that at any moment we may turn a corner and encounter one of them. Children also believe this, and because they and I have this conviction in common, we, as creator and audience, make good partners." Sandra lives in Seattle, Washington, with her husband, Harold.PreSchool-Grade 1-- America's most endearing Rottweiler is left in the park by his mistress to mind not only the baby but also a friend's frisky puppy. Fans of Good Dog, Carl (Green Tiger Pr., 1985), Carl Goes Shopping (1989), and Carl's Christmas (1990, both Farrar) will not be surprised to learn that he rises to the occasion. The baby seems a tiny bit older in this book and expectantly clambers onto Carl's back the moment the adults disappear. The venturesome trio embarks on a series of merry capers: a romp in a flower bed, a splash with a hose, a ride on a merry-go-round (with Carl as the "horse"), and so on. In one of the funnier scenes, Carl and the baby pose for a painting class and are rendered cubistically, abstractly, and impressionistically by the students. As always, Carl returns his charges safely to their point of origin--just in time to receive his unsuspecting mistress's commendation. In her familiar realistic, painterly style, Day is a master of sweet but not cloying illustration. Her colors are bright and clear; her animals and children expressive and appealing. The flow of the episodic events may seem slightly truncated in spots (e.g., the puppy, lifted aloft by a balloon, is grasped by the baby but the next plate shows both baby and puppy having an ice-cream cone). It's a minor quibble. The fact that no responsible adult would ever leave a baby unattended in a public park today and that, after three books, the concept is not as original and fresh, will matter little to the followers of Day's wordless fantasies. --Kate McClelland, Perrot Memorial Library, Greenwich, CT<br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>KISS Guide to Feng Shui (Keep It Simple Series)</h2><p>Kiss the competition goodbye!

Regardless of theological bias, no one can help being charmed by the writings of G.K. Chesterton. His Father Brown mysteries, as well as his many works of theology and literary criticism, shine with wit and insight. Belmonte approaches his task of biography with the same fondness for his subject as he demonstrated in William Wilberforce: A Hero for Humanity. Reading this is a bit like taking a tour of literary and social England through the eyes of a man who lived, and loved, the world around him. And even as we read H.L. Mencken&#x2122;s barbed comments about Chesterton and Chesterton&#x2122;s assessment of George Bernard Shaw (&#x153;three of the more incandescent minds of the era ), we get lost in an earlier time and world taken with Chesterton&#x2122;s undeniable brilliance. The articulate Belmonte makes his material sing. Chesterton was that rarity of a man: a convert to Catholicism, whose life can be celebrated by an evangelical publisher.&nbsp;A wonderful book on all counts. (Jan.) <br>(c) Copyright PWxyz, LLC.

Canada, for coverage of so vast a territory, engaged 100 international photographers (to Israelis ' mostly native 55), to produce 100,000 images (to Israelis ' 40,000), from which its several hundred memorable black-and-white and color illustrations were chosen. The photos juxtapose the industrial to the rural. A lively essay recounts experiences organizing the project and photographing on the actual day (June 8, 1984). The photographers get credit next to their pictures; a map shows where each worked that day; and a lengthy section gives their respective backgrounds, illustrated with past work. Israelis seems earnest, even somber, in comparison. With more than 300 equally fine images, it plays down the individual artists, presenting only a list of credits at the end. The introduction discusses not so much this project as the past and present social and political developments in this young nation, placing the images firmly in context. And indeed, throughout the coverage of agriculture, sheep, beaches, and apartment houses are the ubiquitous soldiers with guns. The heat and aridity are everywhere evident on this day (May 10, 1984) in the ``green'' month, before things are parched to brown. Both books use a chronological arrangement and tell when, to the hour, the pictures were taken, but Canada , being so large, offers maps on each page to show the geographical location of particular images. Both recommended for their candid presentation of ordinary daily life.

This book explains how to cut down on unnecessary trivia. Using photographic examples of scenes he has painted, the author describes what he would eliminate, what needs to be changed, and what techniques should be employed to ensure a successful result. Numerous finished paintings and colour-sketches are presented to illustrate the points made, and separate chapters on buildings, trees and skies outline specific problems and how they can be overcome. The author is an artist whose work has been exhibited in Europe, Australia and South Africa. He also runs residential watercolour courses, and has written several other books on watercolour techniques, as well as biographies of Edward Seago and Edward Wesson.</p><p></p><h2>Uncivil Society: 1989 and the Implosion of the Communist Establishment (Modern Library Chronicles)</h2><p>Twenty years ago, the Berlin Wall fell. In one of modern history&#x2019;s most miraculous occurrences, communism imploded&#x2013;and not with a bang, but with a whimper. Now two of the foremost scholars of East European and Soviet affairs, Stephen Kotkin and Jan T. Gross, drawing upon two decades of reflection, revisit this crash. In a crisp, concise, unsentimental narrative, they employ three case studies&#x2013;East Germany, Romania, and Poland&#x2013;to illuminate what led Communist regimes to surrender, or to be swept away in political bank runs. This is less a story of dissidents, so-called civil society, than of the bankruptcy of a ruling class&#x2013;communism&#x2019;s establishment, or &#x201c;uncivil society.&#x201d; The Communists borrowed from the West like drunken sailors to buy mass consumer goods, then were unable to pay back the hard-currency debts and so borrowed even more. In Eastern Europe, communism came to resemble a Ponzi scheme, one whose implosion carries enduring lessons. From East Germany&#x2019;s pseudotechnocracy to Romania&#x2019;s megalomaniacal dystopia, from Communist Poland&#x2019;s cult of Mary to the Kremlin&#x2019;s surprise restraint, Kotkin and Gross pull back the curtain on the fraud and decadence that cashiered the would-be alternative to the market and democracy, an outcome that opened up to a deeper global integration that has proved destabilizing.</p><p>Stephen Kotkin is Rosengarten Professor of Modern and Contemporary History at Princeton University, with a joint appointment as Professor of International Affairs in the Woodrow Wilson School. He is the author of the enormously influential books <i>Magnetic Mountain:Stalinism as a Civilization and Armageddon Averted: The Soviet Collapse 1970&#x2014;2000</i> and contributes regularly to <i>The New York Times, The New Republic</i>,<i> </i>and the BBC.<br><br>Jan T. Gross a native of Poland, also teaches at Princeton, where he is the Norman B. Tomlinson &#x2019;16 and &#x2019;48 Professor of War and Society. He was a 2001 National Book Award nominee for his widely acclaimed <i>Neighbors: The Destruction of the Jewish Community in Jedwabne, Poland.</i> His most recent book, <i>Fear:Anti-Semitism in Poland after Auschwitz</i>, was named one of the best books of the year by <i>The Washington Post</i>.<i>Chapter One<br><br>Bank Run&nbsp;<br><br>&#x201c;How did you go bankrupt?<br>&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x201c;Two ways. Gradually and then suddenly.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Ernest Hemingway, The Sun Also Rises<br><br></i>The wry Romanian film <i>A fost sau n- a fost? </i>(2006), known in En -&nbsp;glish as <i>12:08 East of Bucharest, </i>poses a seemingly passe question:&nbsp;Was there or was there not&#x2014;&#x201c;A fost sau n- a fost?&#x201d;&#x2014;a revolution in&nbsp;1989? Most of the film takes place at a desk, as an on- air discussion&nbsp;inside a television studio. (It is often said that Romania&#x2019;s 1989 events&nbsp;took place mostly on TV.) The pompous host (who is given to quoting&nbsp;Herodotus) is called Virgil Jderescu, a provincial TV station&nbsp;owner whose talk show is called <i>Issue of the Day. </i>This particular day is&nbsp;December 22, 2005, and the issue is what happened on the same date&nbsp;sixteen years earlier. After some potential panelists bow out, Jderescu&nbsp;goes live with a debt- ridden, alcoholic history teacher named Tiberiu&nbsp;M&#x222b;nescu and a grumpy, lonely pensioner named Emanoil Piscoci&nbsp;who dresses up as Santa Claus for children. The telecast backdrop&nbsp;shows the live image of a drab, unnamed Stalinist- style wide town&nbsp;square (thought to be Vaslui, the eastern Romanian hometown of the&nbsp;film&#x2019;s director, Corneliu Porumboiu). The film&#x2019;s nonaction is riveting:&nbsp;three men sitting in chairs. Jderescu keeps asking &#x201c;Was there, or&nbsp;was there not, a revolution in our town?&#x201d; M&#x222b;nescu recounts how on&nbsp;December 22, 1989, he had gone to their town square with three&nbsp;other teachers&#x2014;conveniently, two are now dead and one departed&nbsp;for Canada&#x2014;before 12:08 p.m., as part of a protesting vanguard. The&nbsp;timing is crucial because Nicolae Ceauoescu, the Romanian dictator,&nbsp;fled Bucharest by helicopter precisely at that time. The Santa Claus&nbsp;impersonator claims that he, too, went to the square, albeit after&nbsp;12:08. Jderescu takes a call to the show: it&#x2019;s the sentry on duty in the&nbsp;town square sixteen years ago, who denounces as a lie M&#x222b;nescu&#x2019;s&nbsp;claim to have been on the square before 12:08. Another caller places&nbsp;M&#x222b;nescu at the corner bar drinking the whole day and night. As&nbsp;callers along with the host impugn M&#x222b;nescu&#x2019;s story, the latter interjects,&nbsp;&#x201c;Why split hairs over such stupidity?&#x201d; The broadcast winds&nbsp;down by depicting&#x2014;live on the studio backdrop&#x2014;forlorn gray buildings, a darkening sky, streetlights turning on, and beautiful snow&nbsp;falling. The last phone- in caller says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just calling to let you know&nbsp;it&#x2019;s snowing outside. It&#x2019;s snowing big white flakes. Enjoy it now, tomorrow&nbsp;it will be mud . . . Merry Christmas, everybody!&#x201d; The woman&nbsp;reveals that she lost her son on December 23, 1989, the day after the&nbsp;revolution.&nbsp;<br><br>The film seems to examine whether a revolution can take place if&nbsp;no one risks anything, at least in this town, and it seems to reinforce a&nbsp;general impression that Romania in 1989 was the grand exception.&nbsp;Romania, it is often said, was the only Eastern European country&nbsp;whose experience in 1989 was supposedly a coup, not a revolution. Or&nbsp;it is said that Romania did have a revolution, but it was stolen.1 Adding&nbsp;to this sense of exceptionalism, Romania turned out to be the only&nbsp;country besides Yugoslavia where socialism&#x2019;s end was bloody. That&nbsp;carnage notwithstanding&#x2014;officially Romania suffered 1,104 dead,&nbsp;mostly after December 22&#x2014;it will be our argument that Romania in&nbsp;1989 was not an exception but part of a continuum that includes East&nbsp;Germany as well as most other cases. Communist Romania had a&nbsp;minuscule opposition. It was a country of Tiberiu M&#x222b;nescus and&nbsp;Emanoil Piscocis, as well as Virgil Jderescus, but, as we shall see, Romania&nbsp;offers a fine example of what could be called nonorganized&nbsp;mobilization, which in 1989 was actually the norm across Eastern Europe.&nbsp;It was Communist- era Poland, usually taken as paradigmatic,&nbsp;that proved to be the grand exception. In Poland, the opposition was&nbsp;not a small coterie of dissidents or groups of people arrayed around&nbsp;private kitchen tables, taking advantage of the mass construction of&nbsp;self- contained (noncommunal) apartments to commiserate in trusted&nbsp;company. The opposition in Poland was societal, with organizations&nbsp;and physical spaces, Sunday sermons and flying universities, and a&nbsp;fully articulated alternative to the regime.2 Yet Romania, not Poland,&nbsp;experienced large street protests in 1989. That year, East Germany,&nbsp;too, had massive street demonstrations, even though, as in Romania,&nbsp;there was relatively little organized opposition.&nbsp;Back in the 1970s, most commentators thought that the capitalist&nbsp;<br><br>West, not communism, was nearing collapse, and even in the second&nbsp;half of the 1980s, Communist systems seemed not doomed but uncertain. Unexpectedly, however, 1989 turned out to be an <i>annus</i>&nbsp;<i>mirabilis, </i>producing revolutions in Eastern Europe that sparked&nbsp;repercussions around the globe, from apartheid South Africa to&nbsp;one- party Mexico. The Romanian case, like the East German one,&nbsp;indicates that much of the interpretive challenge consists in analyzing&nbsp;how East European Communist regimes fell in the absence of&nbsp;organized oppositions. This requires a different understanding of&nbsp;social process from the usual invocation of something called &#x201c;civil&nbsp;society.&#x201d; The latter slogan has proved to be catnip to scholars, pundits,&nbsp;and foreign aid donors.3 After &#x201c;modernization theory&#x201d; (the hugely influential&nbsp;1950s&#x2013;1970s developmental ideology) had morphed by&nbsp;the 1980s into &#x201c;democracy promotion,&#x201d; the notion of &#x201c;civil society&#x201d;&nbsp;became the conceptual equivalent of the &#x201c;bourgeoisie&#x201d; or &#x201c;middle&nbsp;class&#x201d;&#x2014;that is, a vague, seemingly all- purpose collective social actor.4&nbsp;It was claptrap. Several hundred (sometimes just several dozen)&nbsp;members of an opposition&#x2014;with a handful of harassed illegal associations&nbsp;and underground self- publications (<i>samizdat</i>)&#x2014;were somehow&nbsp;a &#x201c;civil society&#x201d;? Meanwhile, <i>hundreds of thousands </i>of party and&nbsp;state officials, political police operatives, army officers&#x2014;who often&nbsp;went to school, worked, and even lived together, controlled all (state)&nbsp;property, public spaces, communications networks, and institutions,&nbsp;and had their own clubs, resorts, and shops&#x2014;were somehow not a&nbsp;society?&nbsp;<br><br>Such widespread misapprehension transpires when normative&nbsp;thinking&#x2014;imagining how things ought to be&#x2014;gets the better of&nbsp;analysis. Needless to say, in 1989 &#x201c;civil society&#x201d; could not have shattered&nbsp;Soviet- style socialism for the simple reason that civil society in&nbsp;Eastern Europe did not then actually exist. The mostly small groups&nbsp;of dissidents, however important morally, could not have constituted&nbsp;any kind of society. On the contrary, it was the establishment&#x2014;the&nbsp;&#x201c;uncivil society&#x201d;&#x2014;that brought down its own system. Each establishment&nbsp;did so by misruling and then, when Mikhail Gorbachev&#x2019;s&nbsp;Kremlin radically shifted the geopolitical rules, by capitulating&#x2014;or&nbsp;by refusing to capitulate and thus making themselves susceptible to&nbsp;political bank runs.5 Suddenly, decades of bravery by disparate dissidents&#x2014;&nbsp;the moral thunderbolts, the &#x201c;antipolitics,&#x201d; the &#x201c;living in dignity&#x201d;&#x2014;were swamped by a cascade of activism on the part of formerly&nbsp;inert masses and by elite opportunism. Would- be totalitarian&nbsp;states, which aspired to total control and total mobilization, by the&nbsp;same token proved to be totally vulnerable.&nbsp;<br><br><i>Civil Society Utopias&nbsp;<br></i><br>Whence the reverie of &#x201c;civil society&#x201d;? Before the eighteenth century,&nbsp;the terms &#x201c;civil society&#x201d; and &#x201c;the state&#x201d; were nearly synonymous and&nbsp;meant essentially political society. But Adam Ferguson (1723&#x2013;1816),&nbsp;along with other thinkers of the Scottish Enlightenment, helped divide&nbsp;the two terms into an opposition (a process continued by G. W. F.&nbsp;Hegel and Alexis de Tocqueville). Ferguson&#x2019;s <i>Essay on the History of&nbsp;Civil Society </i>(Edinburgh, 1767) contrasted a civilized rule- of- law society&nbsp;to a barbarous one. His text came out in eight editions up to&nbsp;1819, but the next English edition had to wait until 1966. Not long&nbsp;thereafter, the term &#x201c;civil society&#x201d; would again burst into vogue, especially&nbsp;among analysts awestruck by the breakthrough of Solidarity&nbsp;in Communist- ruled Poland.6 Suddenly, individuals and groups&nbsp;around Eastern Europe that opposed Communist systems were said&nbsp;to constitute an emergent civil society&#x2014;that is, &#x201c;autonomous&#x201d; forces&nbsp;outside the state and, in these instances, against the state. Such recourse&nbsp;to the concept of &#x201c;civil society&#x201d; in fact exaggerated the role of&nbsp;intellectuals (at the expense of workers, churches, and the world&nbsp;economy).7 More consequentially, the supposed mutual exclusiveness&nbsp;of civil society and state produced a skewed characterization of&nbsp;society in terms of how a society was (self- )organized. True, social&nbsp;organization is not to be taken for granted; it must be achieved, and&nbsp;sustained. But a society is also profoundly shaped by how the state is&nbsp;organized.8 &#x201c;Civil society&#x201d; was in many ways the conceptual counterpart&nbsp;to the concept of totalitarianism, but if it was precisely the&nbsp;all- encompassing totalitarian despotism that made the term &#x201c;civil society&#x201d;&#x2014;&nbsp;as s...</p><h2>Frank Lloyd Wright - Taliesin East: GA Traveller 001</h2><p>Built as a wintertime activity base in the middle of Arizona desert,Taliesin West offers a complete different view from Taliesin amidst the vast natural setting in Wisconsin. <br> The two points and lines are evidences that Wright's designs have sprouted from mother nature.

Those expecting either a comprehensive history of the modern Palestinian movement or a polemic against Zionism and Israel should look elsewhere. Khalidi, who teaches history and directs the Center for International Studies at the University of Chicago, and who was a member of the Palestinian delegation to the Mideast peace negotiations, focuses almost entirely on the late Ottoman and early Mandate period (1880s through 1920s). He sees Palestinian nationalism emerging far earlier than is generally thought--in the preWW I period, when absentee landlords in Beirut and elsewhere sold large tracts of Palestinian land to the Jewish Colonization Association. Yet while modern Palestinian history is inextricably intertwined with that of Zionism, Khalidi focuses as much on other constituents of modern Palestinian identity, which include ``patriotic feelings, local loyalties, Arabism, religious sentiments, [and] higher levels of education and literacy.'' He demonstrates how the long-term influence of modernization, the collapse of the Ottoman Empire, and concomitant European incursion in the preWW I era, followed by the betrayal of promises made by both the British and French, contributed as much to Palestinian nationalism as the 1917 Balfour Declaration and Zionist immigration. The only flaw here is that Khalidi races through the last 70 years of the development of Palestinian identity. Even here, however, he offers a fascinating analysis of why Palestinian nationalism seemingly became ``submerged'' after the first Arab- Israeli War (194749) and until the PLO's founding in 1964. At a time when the end of the hundred years' war between Zionism/Israel and the Palestinians appears on the horizon, this illuminating study will help readers gain a sophisticated understanding of how the Palestinians came to be who they are. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

By chance, the sister had a friend who worked at Christie&#x2019;s, so she dropped them off--in four Sainsbury&#x2019;s grocery sacks--at the auctioneer&#x2019;s salesroom on Old Brompton Road, hoping they might &#x201c;take a look and tell us if they&#x2019;re worth anything.&#x201d;<br><br>When the senior specialist of Chinese Classical Paintings opened up one of the silk scrolls, he nearly went into cardiac arrest. Unfurled before him was an image so remarkably rendered, it immediately reminded him of a set of hanging scroll paintings long thought to be destroyed. Could this be The Palace of Eighteen Perfections? The artwork, created by the Qing dynasty artist Yuan Jiang in 1693, was believed to have been secretly removed from China during the Second Opium War in 1860, when many of the royal palaces were ransacked, and lost forever.<br><br>As staffers scurried around unrolling the scrolls, they discovered twenty-four pieces, each almost seven feet tall and in immaculate condition. Placed side by side, they spanned thirty-seven feet, almost filling the floor space of two workrooms. At last, the senior specialist could confirm that this was undoubtedly the mythical work described in all the classical Chinese texts he had spent much of his career studying.<br><br>The Palace of Eighteen Perfections was an opulent eighth-century imperial retreat in the mountains north of modern-day Xi&#x2019;an. It was said to be one of the most magnificent royal residences ever built, with grounds so vast that one had to travel between the halls on horseback. On these ancient silk scrolls, the intricate pavilions, courtyards, and gardens that meandered through a dreamlike blue-and-green mountain landscape were painted in colors so vibrantly preserved, they seemed almost electric in their iridescence.<br><br>The auction-house staff stood over the exquisite masterpiece in awed silence. A find of this caliber was like discovering a long-hidden painting by da Vinci or Vermeer. When the international director of Asian Art rushed in to see them, he began to feel faint and forced himself to take a few steps back for fear that he might fall onto the delicate artwork. Choking back his tears, the director finally said, &#x201c;Call Fran�ois in Hong Kong. Tell him to get Oliver T&#x2019;sien on the next flight to London.&#x201d;1<br><br>The director then declared, &#x201c;We need to give these beauties the grand tour. We&#x2019;re going to start out with an exhibition in Geneva, then London, then at our Rockefeller Center showroom in New York. Let&#x2019;s give the world&#x2019;s top collectors a chance to see it. Only then will we take it to Hong Kong, and sell it right before the Chinese New Year. By then the Chinese should be frothing at the mouth in anticipation.&#x201d;<br><br>Which is precisely how Corinna Ko-Tung came to be sitting in the Clipper Lounge of the Mandarin Hotel in Hong Kong a year later, impatiently awaiting the arrival of Lester and Valerie Liu. Her richly embossed business card listed her as an &#x201c;art consultant,&#x201d; but for a few select clients, she was a great deal more than that. Corinna was born to one of Hong Kong&#x2019;s most pedigreed families, and she secretly parlayed her extensive connections into a very profitable sideline. For clients like the Lius, Corinna did everything from refining the art on their walls to the clothes on their back--all in service of getting them memberships at the most elite clubs, their names onto the right invitation lists, and their children into the city&#x2019;s top schools. In short, she was a special consultant for social climbers.<br><br>Corinna spotted the Lius as they ascended the short flight of stairs up to the mezzanine lounge overlooking the lobby. The couple cut quite a striking picture, and she had to pat herself on the back for this. The first time Corinna met the Lius, they were both in head-to-toe Prada. To these new arrivals from Guangdong, it was the height of sophistication, but to Corinna, it just screamed clueless Mainland money. Thanks to her handiwork, Lester entered the Clipper Lounge looking particularly dapper in a bespoke three-piece suit from Kilgour of Savile Row, and Valerie was chicly clad in a silvery Persian lamb parka from J. Mendel, appropriately sized black pearls, and dove-gray suede Lanvin ankle boots. But there was something a little off about her outfit--the handbag was a mistake. The glossy ombre-dyed reptile-skin bag obviously came from some nearly extinct species, but it reminded Corinna of the sort of handbag only a mistress would carry. She made a mental note to drop a hint at the appropriate moment.<br><br>Valerie arrived at the table apologizing profusely. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry we&#x2019;re late. Our chauffeur mistakenly took us to the Landmark Mandarin Oriental instead of this one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not a problem,&#x201d; Corinna replied graciously. Tardiness was one of her pet peeves, but with the kind of retainer the Lius were paying her, she wasn&#x2019;t about to complain.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised you wanted to meet here. Don&#x2019;t you think the tearoom at the Four Seasons is much nicer?&#x201d; Valerie asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Or even the Peninsula,&#x201d; Lester chimed in, casting a dismissive eye at the rectangular 1970s-era chandeliers cascading from the ceiling of the lobby.<br><br>&#x201c;The Peninsula gets too many tourists, and the Four Seasons is where all the new people go. The Mandarin is where proper Hong Kong families have been coming to tea for generations. My grandmother Lady Ko-Tung used to bring me here at least once a month when I was a girl,&#x201d; Corinna patiently explained, adding, &#x201c;You must also leave out the &#x2018;Oriental&#x2019;--we locals simply call it &#x2018;the Mandarin.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Valerie replied, feeling a little chastised. She glanced around, taking in the subdued oak-paneled walls and armchairs with just the perfect amount of sag in the seat cushions, her eyes suddenly widening. Leaning closer in, she whispered excitedly to Corinna, &#x201c;Do you see who&#x2019;s over there? Isn&#x2019;t that Fiona Tung-Cheng with her mother-in-law, Alexandra Cheng, having tea with the Ladoories?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who are they?&#x201d; Lester asked, a little too loudly.<br><br>Valerie nervously shushed her husband in Mandarin. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stare--I&#x2019;ll tell you later!&#x201d;<br><br>Corinna smiled in approval. That Valerie was a quick study. The Lius were relatively new clients, but they were Corinna&#x2019;s favorite type of clients--Red Royals, she called them. Unlike fresh-off-the-boat Mainlander millionaires, these heirs of China&#x2019;s ruling class--known in China as fuerdai, or &#x201c;second-generation-rich&#x201d;--had good manners and good teeth, and had never known the deprivation of their parents&#x2019; generation. The tragedies of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution were ancient history as far as they were concerned. Obscene gobs of money had come easily to them, so obscene gobs they were ready to part with.<br><br>Lester&#x2019;s family controlled one of China&#x2019;s largest insurance companies, and he met Valerie, the Shanghai-born daughter of an anesthesiologist, when they were both at the University of Sydney. With an ever-growing fortune and ever-refining taste, this thirtysomething couple was ambitiously striving to make their mark on the power scene in Asia. With homes in London, Shanghai, Sydney, and New York, and a newly constructed house that resembled a cruise liner in Hong Kong&#x2019;s Deep Water Bay, they were anxiously filling the walls with museum-quality art in the hopes that Hong Kong Tattle might soon do a feature.<br><br>Lester got right down to business. &#x201c;So how much do you think these scrolls will end up going for?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, that&#x2019;s what I wanted to discuss with you. I know you said you were prepared to go up to fifty million, but I have a feeling we will break all records tonight. Would you be prepared to go up to seventy-five?&#x201d; Corinna said carefully, testing the waters.<br><br>Lester didn&#x2019;t flinch. He reached for one of the sausage puffs on the silver cake stand and said, &#x201c;Are you sure it&#x2019;s worth that much?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Liu, this is the single most important work of Chinese art to ever come on the market. It&#x2019;s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to look so good in the rotunda!&#x201d; Valerie couldn&#x2019;t help blurting out. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to hang it so that the whole painting is panoramic, and I&#x2019;m having the walls on the first and second floors repainted to exactly match the colors. I love those turquoise tones . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Corinna ignored Valerie&#x2019;s chatter and continued. &#x201c;Aside from the artwork itself, the value of owning it will be incalculable. Think how much it will raise your profile--your family&#x2019;s profile--once it&#x2019;s known that you acquired it. You will have beat out the top collectors in the world. I&#x2019;m told that representatives for the Bins, the Wangs, and the Kuoks are bidding. And the Huangs just flew in from Taipei--interesting timing, isn&#x2019;t it? I also have it on good authority that Colin and Araminta Khoo sent a special team of curators from the National Palace Museum in Taipei to examine the piece last week.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ooh--Araminta Khoo. She&#x2019;s so beautiful and chic! I couldn&#x2019;t stop reading about that incredible wedding of hers. Do you know her?&#x201d; Valerie asked.<br><br>&#x201c;I was at the wedding,&#x201d; Corinna said simply.<br><br>Valerie shook her head in wonder. She tried to imagine the middle-aged, mousy-looking Corinna, who always wore the same three Giorgio Armani pantsuits, at the most glamorous event ever to hit Asia. Some people had all the luck, being born into the right family.<br><br>Corinna continued her lecture. &#x201c;So let me give you the drill. The auction tonight begins at eight sharp, and I have secured us entry to the Christie&#x2019;s VVIP skybox. That is where you will be throughout the auction. I will be downstairs on the auction room floor, bidding exclusively for you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We won&#x2019;t be with you?&#x201d; Valerie was confused.<br><br>&#x201c;No, no. You&#x2019;ll be in this special lounge where you can look down onto all the action.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But won&#x2019;t it be more exciting to be down on the floor itself?&#x201d; Valerie pressed on.<br><br>Corinna shook her head. &#x201c;Trust me, you don&#x2019;t want to be seen on the auction floor. The VVIP skybox is where you want to be. That&#x2019;s where all the top collectors will be, and I know you will enjoy that--&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait a minute,&#x201d; Lester interrupted. &#x201c;What&#x2019;s the point of buying the damn thing then? How will anyone know we made the winning bid?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;First of all, you will be seen by everyone at the VVIP skybox, so people will already suspect, and first thing tomorrow, I will have one of my sources at the South China Morning Post issue an unconfirmed report that Mr. and Mrs. Lester Liu of the Harmony Insurance family acquired the painting. Trust me, that&#x2019;s the classy way to do it. You want people to speculate. You want to be that unconfirmed report.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ooh, you&#x2019;re so brilliant, Corinna!&#x201d; Valerie squealed in excitement.<br><br>&#x201c;But if it&#x2019;s &#x2018;unconfirmed,&#x2019; how will people know?&#x201d; Lester was still confused.<br><br>&#x201c;Hiyah, slow tortoise, everyone will see the painting when we throw our housewarming party next month,&#x201d; Valerie chastised her husband, smacking him on the knee. &#x201c;They will confirm it with their own envious eyes!&#x201d;<br>The Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Centre, situated right on the harbor in Wan Chai, boasted overlapping curved roofs that resembled a gigantic manta ray gliding through the water. That same evening, a parade of starlets, boldface-name socialites, low-level billionaires, and the sort of people Corinna Ko-Tung deemed to be inconsequential paraded through the Grand Hall, vying for the most visible seats at the auction of the century, while the back of the room was packed to the rafters with the international press and onlookers. Upstairs in the plush VVIP skybox, Valerie and Lester were in seventh heaven as they rubbed elbows with the serious-money crowd over Laurent-Perrier champagne and canapes prepared by Cafe Gray.<br><br>When at last the auctioneer stepped up to the polished wood podium, the lights in the hall began to dim. A massive gold latticework screen ran along the wall facing the stage, and at the appointed moment, the screen began to part, revealing the hanging scrolls in all their glory. Brilliantly enhanced by the state-of-the-art lighting system, they almost appeared to glow from within. The crowd gasped, and when the lights came up again, the auctioneer promptly began the session without any fuss: &#x201c;An exceedingly rare set of twenty-four hanging scrolls from the Qing dynasty, ink and color on silk, depicting the Palace of Eighteen Perfections, by Yuan Jiang. Inscribed by the artist, and dated 1693. Shall we have an opening bid of--one million?&#x201d;<br><br>Valerie could feel the adrenaline coursing through her veins as she saw Corinna raise her blue-numbered paddle to volley the first bid. A flurry of paddles began popping up around the room, and the price began its stratospheric climb. Five million. Ten million. Twelve million. Fifteen million. Twenty million. Within a matter of minutes, the bid was at forty million. Lester leaned forward in his chair, analyzing the action on the auction-room floor like some complex chess match, and Valerie clawed her nails into his shoulder repeatedly in high anticipation.<br><br>When the bidding hit sixty million, Lester&#x2019;s phone rang. It was Corinna sounding frantic. &#x201c;Suey doh sei,2 it&#x2019;s going up too fast! We&#x2019;re going to pass your seventy-five-million limit in no time. Do you want to keep bidding?&#x201d;<br><br>Lester breathed in deeply. Any expenditure over fifty million would surely be noticed by his father&#x2019;s bean counters, and there would be some explaining to do. &#x201c;Keep going till I stop you,&#x201d; he ordered.<br><br>Valerie&#x2019;s head was spinning in excitement. They were so close. Imagine, soon she would own something that even Araminta Khoo coveted! At eighty million, the bidding finally slowed down. No more paddles in the room were raised with the exception of Corinna&#x2019;s, and it seemed like there were only two or three telephone buyers remaining to bid against the Lius. The price was going up only in increments of half a million, and Lester closed his eyes, praying he would get it for under ninety million. It was worth it. It was worth the scolding he would get from his father. He would make his plea that he had bought the family a billion dollars&#x2019; worth of good publicity.<br><br>Suddenly there came a commotion from the back of the auction room. Murmurs could be heard as the standing-room-only crowd began to give way. Even in a room packed with celebrities dressed to the nines, a hush came over the space as a strikingly attractive Chinese woman with jet-black hair, powdered white skin, and crimson lips, dramatically dressed in a black velvet off-the-shoulder gown, emerged from the crowd. Flanked by two snow-white Russian wolfhounds on long diamond leashes, the lady began to walk slowly up the central aisle as every head swiveled toward the sensational sight.<br><br>Clearing his throat discreetly into the mic, the auctioneer tried to regain the attention of the room. &#x201c;I have eighty-five point five million, who will say eighty-six?&#x201d;<br><br>1 Oliver T&#x2019;sien--one of Christie&#x2019;s most highly valued deputy chairmen--has long-standing relationships with many of the world&#x2019;s top collectors.

In the intervening years his award-winning novels and stories have solidified his reputation both in fantasy and science fiction with a cascade of stunning achievements. No sf writer has been more highly and continually praised.<br>Now Wolfe returns to science fiction with a mighty multi-volume mega-novel of mystery, war, and revolution, The Book of the Long Sun, set on a world, the Whorl, existing inside a giant starship sent from Urth to colonize a distant planet. Wolfe's previous work in this future universe has been hailed as a "major landmark of contemporary American literature" by Booklist, and "a masterpiece of science fantasy comparable in importance to the major works of Tolkien and Lewis" by Publishers Weekly.<br>Enormous in breadth and scope, Wolfe's ambitious new work opens out into a world of wonders, of gods and humans, aliens and machines, and mysterious adventures far out in space and deep inside the human spirit. It is set on a ship-world whose origins are shrouded in legend, ruled by strange gods who appear infrequently to their worshippers on large screens, and peopled by a human race changed by eons of time, yet familiar.<br>Nightside the Long Sun is the beginning of a masterpiece of science fiction for this decade. Life on the Whorl, and the struggles and triumphs of Patera Silk to satisfy the demands of the gods, will captivate readers yearning for something new and different in science fiction, for the magic of the future. The Book of the Long Sun is launched with success.</p><p>Wolfe's first novel since Pandora by Holly Hollander (1990) is a vivid and compelling evocation of life inside an interstellar spacecraft so huge that a whole world of cities and wildernesses exists within it, and so old that its origins and purpose are mere legends to its inhabitants. Patera Silk, a young priest in one of the city of Viron's poorest temples ("manteions"), receives a mental message from one of his gods, an enlightenment which invests his life with urgent meaning. On the same day, however, he learns his manteion had been sold for back taxes and may well be dismantled. Armed with the conviction of his revelation, Silk enlists the aid of a local but decent-hearted thief, intent upon breaking into the mansion of Blod, the new owner of the manteion, to convince (or even force) him to guarantee its survival. From that point on, Silk is drawn even deeper into the shady world outside his temple walls. But for all its interest, the plot is hardly the most powerful element. The atmosphere of Wolfe's spacecraft seduces and amazes, details and mystery piling upon each other to yield a sense of palpable otherworldliness. The environment of the long sun--so called because the ship's cylindrical interior is lit by a central tubular "sun" extending the length of the ship--comes energetically alive, and readers will be grateful that this book begins a four-volume series. If this first taste is any test, Wolfe has embarked on an epic to rival his acclaimed Book of the New Sun. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.The first installment in another multivolume, far-future saga (like Wolfe's The Book of the New Sun tetralogy, 1980-87), set inside...well, something--a supercolossal spaceship? a ringworld? a Dyson sphere?--that has its own sun, seasons, and a land surface that curves up in the distance to form the sky; until recently, this world's numerous ruling gods communicated with humans via ``Sacred Windows'' from their remote Mainframe home. Here, in a poor, decaying section of the city Viron, augur and religious leader Patera Silk receives enlightenment from a god, the Outsider, only to learn that his temple has been sold in lieu of unpaid taxes to the rich businessman Blood. Somehow, Silk must persuade Blood not to demolish the temple and redevelop the neighborhood. So Silk breaks into Blood's heavily defended villa, intending threats or bluff; after various weird incidents, Silk sustains a broken ankle and obtains Blood's undertaking to sell the temple back to Silk for twice the original price. Silk also agrees to exorcise Blood's bordello--the scene of a number of unpleasant and ultimately murderous hauntings. A typically unsettling, utterly mysterious blend of sacrifice, spies, exorcism, cyborgs, ghosts, androids, robots, genetic engineering, gods, computers, and what-all. The clever plotting, solid characters, and intriguing backdrop work splendidly in close- up, but their larger significance remains annoyingly unexplained, indeed barely even intimated. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But Miss Wonderley is in fact the beautiful and treacherous Brigid O&#39;Shaughnessy, and when Spade&#39;s partner Miles Archer is shot while on Thursby&#39;s trail, Spade finds himself both hunter and hunted: can he track down the jewel-encrusted bird, a treasure worth killing for, before the Fat Man finds him?</p><p>Sam Spade, Dashiell Hammett's archetypally tough San Francisco detective, is more <i>noir</i> than <i>L.A. Confidential</i> and more vulnerable than Raymond Chandler's Marlowe. In <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, the best known of Hammett's Sam Spade novels (including <i>The Dain Curse</i> and <i>The Glass Key</i>), Spade is tough enough to bluff the toughest thugs and hold off the police, risking his reputation when a beautiful woman begs for his help, while knowing that betrayal may deal him a new hand in the next moment.<p> Spade's partner is murdered on a stakeout; the cops blame him for the killing; a beautiful redhead with a heartbreaking story appears and disappears; grotesque villains demand a payoff he can't provide; and everyone wants a fabulously valuable gold statuette of a falcon, created as tribute for the Holy Roman Emperor Charles IV. Who has it? And what will it take to get it back? Spade's solution is as complicated as the motives of the seekers assembled in his hotel room, but the truth can be a cold comfort indeed.</p><p> Spade is bigger (and blonder) in the book than in the <i>movie</i>, and his Mephistophelean countenance is by turns seductive and volcanic. Sam knows how to fight, whom to call, how to rifle drawers and secrets without leaving a trace, and just the right way to call a woman "Angel" and convince her that she is. He is the quintessence of intelligent cool, with a wise guy's perfect pitch. If you only know the movie, read the book. If you're riveted by <i>Chinatown</i> or wonder where Robert B. Parker's Spenser gets his comebacks, read the master. <i>--Barbara Schlieper</i></p>"Dashiell Hammett. . . is a master of the detective novel, yes, but also one hell of a writer." --<b>The Boston Globe</b><br><br>"<b>The Maltese Falcon</b> is not only probably the best detective story we have ever read, it is an exceedingly well written novel."--<b>The Times Literary Supplement</b> (London)<br><br>"Hammett's prose [is] clean and entirely unique.

Echoes of Ezekiel--with its words of doom and promises of hope, the vision of a new temple and its scroll-eating prophet--are especially apparent in the book of Revelation. Daniel is most notable in supplying terminology and imagery for Jesus of Nazareth&#39;s favored self-description as &#34;Son of man,&#34; a phrase also found in Ezekiel and one which John the seer employs repeatedly in describing the exalted figure of his vision on the island of Patmos. The four beasts of Daniel find their counterparts in the lion, ox, man and eagle of Ezekiel and Revelation. It is no wonder these books, despite the difficulties in interpreting them, took hold on the imagination of the early church. Over forty church fathers are cited in the commentary on Ezekiel, some of whom are here translated into English for the first time, but pride of place goes to four significant extant works: the homilies of Origen and Gregory the Great, and the commentaries of Jerome and Theodoret of Cyr, thus bridging East and West, North and South. A similar array of fathers are found within the commentary on Daniel. Extensive comments derive from the works of Theodoret of Cyr, Hippolytus, Jerome and Isho&#39;dad of Merv and provide a wealth of insight. Valuable commentary attributed to Ephrem the Syrian and John Chrysostom is also found here, though the authorship of these commentaries is indeed questioned.

His study, The Mystical Theology of the Eastern Church, was widely recognized not only as an authoritative presentation of Orthodox theology but also as a challenge to the prevailing Western understanding of God-man relations. Yet only in the posthumous publication of Lossky&#39;s many other works has the full extent of his contribution to modern Christian thought been revealed. Orthodox Theology: An Introduction was originally intended as a course in dogmatic theology. It investigates the fundamental questions every theologian must ask: Can we know God? What is the relation of the creation to the Creator? How did man fall, and how is he saved? Lossky shows that such doctrinal issues are not merely abstract propositions for theological debate but affect the whole Christian life. Thus, as Lossky demonstrates, the Orthodox tradition of the Trinity is directly related to the Orthodox understanding of the human person. For, like the divine Persons of the Trinity, the human person in its absolute uniqueness yet equally absolute &#34;relatedness&#34; to other persons can only be understood theologically.</p><p>Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Perfect London Walk</h2><p>Describes a walking tour in London, off the beaten path, and shares observations on British customs and history, and points of interest along the way</p><p></p><h2>Ultimate Fighting Techniques (Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu series)</h2><p>Royce Gracie presents an array of fighting strategies specifically designed to succeed under the rules of mixed martial arts competition.

It happens to everyone, but few of us acknowledge these occurrences as manifestations of our own psychic ability. Now, bestselling author Belleruth Naparstek reclaims the world of psychic phenomena from its sideshow trappings, examining scientific data and showing each of us how to tap our own latent powers of awareness and perception. <p> Naparstek, one of the country's leading teachers and speakers on developing the powers of the mind and heart, has trained thousands of individuals in using guided imagery techniques for psychic development and improved health and healing. Her powerful techniques have reached a wide audience--from "the intuitively gifted to those whose third eye seemed virtually cemented shut." </p><p> With <em>Your Sixth Sense,</em> Naparstek shares her proven methods in a guide that is both practical and wonderfully informative. Based on her own experience, her work with clients, and interviews with more than forty highly skilled "intuitives," or psychics, <em>Your Sixth Sense</em> provides both a thorough exploration of the nature of psychic ability--how and why it works--and a step-by-step guide filled with specific suggestions and exercises carefully designed to help you foster, track, and illuminate your own rich output of psychic experience. </p><p> In an engaging, conversational style, Naparstek tackles the subject so often shunted to the realm of cut-rate fortune tellers, psychic hotlines, and television exposes on the paranormal, offering a thoroughly accessible scientific explanation of the physics of ESP, a detailed description of what happens in the mind just before and during an intuitive "pop," and much more. <em>Your Sixth Sense</em> is the only guide you'll need for recognizing, utilizing, and expanding the dormant powers of your own mind.</p><p></p><blockquote> This is a book about how to recognize, cultivate, and direct the natural gift that we all are born with: our sixth sense. When all is said and done, our ability to know things in a way that leaps over "normal" cognition and perception and just shows up as a sudden intuition or a pop of psychic awareness is an altogether logical, natural, and predictable human skill. This book shows you how the sixth sense is simply standard-issue equipment, along with our eyes, ears, tongues, noses and skin. It is only as magical and as ordinary as they are--which is plenty magical enough--but no more and no less. <br>--from the Preface <p> " I loved this book. Reading it was an experience of remembering my own intuition and learning to trust it even more. Belleruth's insights are practical, grounded, validating, and helpful. This is a well-researched, thoughtful how-to-book, filled with stories and exercises, and accessible at any number of levels. There is truly something here for everyone." <br>--Christiane Northrup, M.D., author of <em>Women's Bodies, Women's Wisdom</em> </p><p> "Belleruth Naparstek's penetrating study of intuitives has transformed this brilliant classic, which unites the logic of the mind with the wisdom of the heart. Her wit, intellect, and compassion not only illuminate the science of the sixth sense but also provide a sound, practical framework for the development ;of psychic potential. Grounded in the cultivation of empathy, the exercises in this book will open your heart and expand your sense of intimate connectedness with this remarkable universe." <br> --Joan Borysenko, Ph.D., author of <em>Minding the Body, Mending the Mind</em> and <em>A Woman's Book of Life</em> </p><p> "I do not know of any other book that combines the wisdom of a psychotherapist, the knowledge of a scholar, the skill of a master hypnotist, the sensitivity of a psychic intuitive, and the memories of a remarkable collection of gifted practitioners. This book is a treasure!" <br>--Jeffrey Mishlove, Ph.D., president of Intuition Network and author of <em>Roots of Consciousness</em></p></blockquote></p><p>Using the same guided imagery techniques she teaches her clients, Belleruth Naparstek shows the reader how to train and use the sixth sense in the same manner one would use any of the other five senses in order to perceive things beyond normal cognition. Naparstek's guided imagery approach not only increases psychic sensitivity, but benefits one's emotional and physical well-being. The approach taken in <i>Your Sixth Sense</i> is clear and systematic, revealing the mechanisms behind the sixth sense, and avoiding the sideshow tendencies of other books on the subject.We've all experiences moments of "knowing" that defy logic and reason. But just what is this extra sense and how does it work? Why do certain life experiences-- falling in love, intense grief, near-death experience, meditation-- seem to bring it on? Let this thoughtful and illuminating guide help you coax out your own intuitive wisdom. <p>Discover the personality traits and personal experiences of more than 40 gifted initiatives. </p><p>Read a simple but brilliant explanation of the physics behind ESP. </p><p>Learn a set of powerful guided imagery exercises that will unlock your sixth sense.</p></p><h2>Power: Its Myths and Mores in American Art 1961-1991</h2><p><p>"A recommended addition to art collections providing informative commentary on contemporary artists." &#x2014;Booklist</p><p>"This provocative catalogue for an exhibition organized by the Indianapolis Museum of Art explores the nature of power and its manifestation in art over the past three decades....

As curator Day ( New Art of Italy ) states in her engaging introduction, the exhibition addresses the ``coercive physical powers . . . and the relationships contained in attitudes of class, race, and gender.'' Concentrating primarily on pop, minimalist and conceptual art, the book features such artists as Andy Warhol, Donald Judd, Barbara Kruger, Robert Longo, Peter Halley and Cindy Sherman. Photographs of the artworks are accompanied by brief explanations of the artists' aesthetic ideas and processes. Chris Burden, for example, has used his own body to ``explore issues of moral and ethical responsibility''; his methods have included being shot and electrocuted. On a milder note, we learn of Nancy Burson's selection of celebrity faces from the database of a machine she calls the ``Interactive Portrait Compositor'' to ``merge and alter,'' revealing ``the homogeneity of the individuals'' our society worships. The illustrations are fleshed out with fine essays by art historians Wallis and Chave and anthropologist Marcus.

Ungainly and awkward as a child, he won an open scholarship to Trinity College, Dublin, and went from there to Magdalen College, Oxford, where he took a First in Greats, won the Newdigate Prize for Poetry and announced that 'Somehow or other I'll be famous, and if not famous, notorious'. In London he set about establishing himself as a poet and wit, and when Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera <i>Patience</i> toured the USA in 1882 he was invited to give a speech before every performance so that American audiences could recognize the 'perfectly precious young aesthete' satirized in the character of Bunthorne. This brought him both celebrity and money, and in 1884 he married Constance Lloyd, by whom he had two sons.He began writing fairy tales while working as editor of <i>The Lady's World</i>, and <i>The Happy Prince</i> was published in 1888. His first play, Vera, had been a failure, but in 1892 <i>Lady Windermere's Fan</i> was staged with great success. This was swiftly followed by three other enomously successful comedies, the most famous being <i>The Importance of Being Earnest </i>(1895). Wilde died in France, aged only 46. His plays remain as popular today as ever before.Although he read his fairy stories to his two young sons, he claimed they were ' . . . not for children, but for childlike people from eighteen to eighty'.</p><h2>Roughing It: Original Illustrations</h2><p><p> A beautiful edition with the formatting and all 300 images from the original first edition published in 1872.

Outsiders are almost never allowed access to Huichol sacred sites and ceremonies; however, James Endredy, after years of friendship with Huichol families, earned the privilege nearly by accident. Swayed by persistent pleading, he agreed to take another gringo into the mountains to one of the Huichols&#x2019; ceremonial centers, and they were both caught. After trial and punishment, Endredy was invited to stay within the sacred lands for the festivities he had illegally intruded upon and found his initiation into the Huichol shamanic tradition had begun. <br> <br>Sharing his intimate conversations and journeys with the shaman he calls &#x201c;Peyote Jesus,&#x201d; the author explains how Huichol belief revolves around the five sacred directions, the five sacred sites, and the five points of attention. As Peyote Jesus explains, the five points of attention refer to dividing your awareness yet staying focused on your inner self. This is not a normal state of consciousness for most people, yet when we maintain these points of attention, we discover our true essence and move closer to God. <br> <br>Endredy undergoes dozens of spiritual journeys with peyote as he makes the pilgrimages to the five sacred Huichol sites with Peyote Jesus. He is shocked by his vision of the Virgin Mary while under peyote&#x2019;s guidance and learns of the deep relationship--strictly on Huichol terms--between their cosmology, Gnosticism, and Christianity, especially Jesus Christ. Providing an inside look at the major ceremonies and peyote rituals of the Huichol, this unexpectedly powerful book reveals the key tenants of the Huichol worldview, their beliefs in the afterlife, and their spiritual work on behalf of all of humanity.</p><p>James Endredy leads workshops throughout the United States, Mexico, and Canada and is actively involved in preserving the world&#x2019;s indigenous cultures and sacred sites. For more than 25 years he has learned shamanic practices from all over the globe and has lived with the Huichol of Mexico for years at a time.

She could imitate his voice to perfection, and Proust himself said to her, "You know everything about me." Her reminiscences of her employer present an intimate picture of the daily life of a great writer who was also a deeply peculiar man, while Madame Albaret herself proves to be a shrewd and engaging companion.</p><p>C�leste Albaret (1892-1984) was born into a peasant family in the mountainous region of Loz�re, France. In 1913, she married Odilon Albaret, a Parisian chauffeur, whose clients included Marcel Proust. Odilon suggested that his new wife, who was lonely in the big city and at a loss for something to do, run errands for Proust, and before long C�leste found herself employed as the writer&#x2019;s full-time (indeed round-the-clock) housekeeper, secretary, and nurse, filling those roles until his death in 1922. In later years, C�leste ran a small hotel in Paris with her husband and daughter, and after Odilon&#x2019;s death in 1960, she became the caretaker of the Mus�e Ravel in the town of Montfort l&#x2019;Amaury. <i>Monsieur Proust</i> was published in 1972. In recognition of her decade-long service to Proust, C�leste Albaret was made a commander of the French Order of Arts and Letters. She died of emphysema at the age of 92.Text: English, French (translation)</p><h2>The Spirit-Filled Woman&#39;s Devotional: Alyse Lounsberry</h2><p>Especially for the Spirit-filled woman, here are classic daily devotions inspired by Pentecostal women of the past such as Maria Woodworth-Etter, Aimee Semple McPherson, Pheobe Palmer, and Polly Wigglesworth.</p><p></p><h2>Stone</h2><p><p><b><i>Stone</i> is a fascinating, fresh and insightful global tour of the world's oldest and most beautiful building material</b></p><p>Featuring more than 170 structures, from prehistory through to today, the book includes an incredible range of buildings: awe-inspiring Neolithic monuments and the epic Pyramids of Giza feature alongside the work of twentieth-century icons, from Mies van der Rohe's seminal Barcelona Pavilion to Marcel Breuer's daring Met building in New York.</p><p>There are also projects by the world's best contemporary architects, from Sn�hetta's angular Norwegian National Opera and Ballet in Oslo to Kengo Kuma's sculptural Chokkura Plaza in Japan and David Chipperfield's geometric Museo Jumex in Mexico City.</p><p>Arranged to promote comparison and discussion, each project includes an extended caption providing a perceptive commentary on the building.</p> <p>An elegant and informative visual exploration, Stone demonstrates the remarkable variety of creative and innovative structures the material has inspired around the world.</p></p><p><p><b>William Hall</b> trained at Central Saint Martins and began his career in the office of the minimalist architect John Pawson.

Method in Music for Older Students. Which Methods? <b> </b> For music educators. </p></p><p>Preface <p> I originally chose to write this book in order to provide an authoritative comparison among the four most commonly practiced methods found in music classrooms. The concept was that such a book could not be written by one author, but must be written by a group, each with impeccable credentials in the method about which he or she was writing. I chose for my co-authors three music educators, each an authority in the approach about which he was to write. </p><p> Robert Abramson, then professor of Music at the Manhattan School of Music, and now at the Julliard School of Music was an obvious choice for the Jaques-Dalcroze chapters. Abramson spent two years at the Jaques-Dalcroze Institute in Geneva, where he obtained the highest level of certification possible in the field, and he has practiced Jaques-Dalcroze techniques successfully in the United States for many years. </p><p> Avon Gillespie, then Associate Professor of Music at North Texas State University, formerly taught at the Orff Institute in Salzburg. In many conversations with him over the years he displayed a remarkably clear vision of the Orff Approach. When I asked him to contribute to the book, he wrote to me "... there is a real need for this philosophy to be elusive and abstract ...." Fortunately I was able to convince him that his writing would not be molded into any "pattern" and he agreed to write the Orff chapters. His untimely death prevented him from contributing to this second edition. When I consulted with our co-authors as to whether I should invite another Orff practitioner to contribute, or to retain the original Orff chapters, they unanimously opted to retain the original chapters. We believe that Gillespie's exposition of Orff to be a model of clarity. He presents the Orff Approach in both an uncompromised and uncompromising way. </p><p> </p><p> My choice for the Comprehensive Musicianship sections was a long time friend, David Woods, who has been involved with this approach since its earliest days. Dr. Woods is presently Dean of the School of Music, Indiana University and was formerly Dean of the School of Music, Oklahoma University. </p><p> With my background of study in Hungary and publication of several books on the Kodaly Method, I was in a position to write the Kodaly chapters as well as to coordinate the whole project. </p><p> The assembling of the project was not easy. The first edition was five years in the making. Each of us had a natural bias for his or her own way of teaching, and to describe that way without expressing a bias was difficult. However, we believe that we succeeded in doing so. </p><p> When the first edition appeared we thought it unlikely that it would ever require revision. After all, the philosophies and practices associated with Jaques-Dalcroze, Kodaly, Orff, and Comprehensive Musicianship were immutable. Superficial techniques might change but the principles would remain unchanged. However, two factors have made this second edition advisable. </p><p> First, the exponential development of technology is changing forever the ways in which knowledge is acquired and disseminated. In the face of the increasing use of technology in music education, it became imperative to examine just what it could offer and how it could be used appropriately to enhance musical learning. For the new sections on technology in this book we were joined by Frank York of James Cook University in Townsville, Australia. York is involved in Distance Education and has made extensive use of technology in his teacher education programs. </p><p> Second, the Music Education National Conference (MENC) has brought forward a definitive set of National Standards for the Arts in Education, and particularly for the teaching and leaning of music in the schools. These excellent guidelines, the culmination of years of work, have, to an extent never realized before, established Music Education as a legitimate subject for serious study&#x2014;a subject in which there are academic and performance expectations and defined levels of achievement. </p><p> To a remarkable extent, these standards reflect the goals and objectives of the four methods explored in this book. The graded achievement standards listed in the National Standards are, at many points, a mirror of the expected outcomes of Jaques-Dalcroze, Kodaly, Orff, and Comprehensive Musicianship. For that reason it seemed important to bring the new National Standards into the framework of this book. We hope that what we have written will help teachers make intelligent and knowledgeable curricular choices. </p><p> Lois Choksy,<br> Professor Emeritus of Music<br> University of Calgary</p><p>Today's music teachers are in a position to make advances that were not dreamed of in the mid-twentieth century by Jacques-Dalcroze, Carl Orff, Zoltan Kodaly, or those who developed Comprehensive Musicianship. Yet the principles espoused by these innovators offer a vision of music education that the world is only beginning to realize. The MENC National Standards include aspects of music literacy and personal fulfillment these methodologies have advocated for many years: music for all, singing as a basis for musicianship, moving to music, instrumental experience, analytical thinking, listening to music, improvising and composing. The authors have designed this book to help teachers promote musical learning in these areas by making knowledgeable curricular choices among methods.</p> <p> <b>Special features set this book apart:</b> </p> <p> </p><ul> <li>1. Goals and Objectives and suggested skill hierarchies are given for each approach in four levels&#x2014;early elementary, upper elementary, middle school-high school, and university.</li> <li>2. Detailed teaching techniques show how to use each method at each level.</li> <li>3. Sample lesson plans include numerous musical examples.</li> <li>4. National Standards are described and discussed.</li> <li>5. Suggestions are given for appropriate use of technology in the study of music.</li> <li>6. The four methods are compared in their approach to creating, moving, singing and playing, musical reading and writing, and performing and listening.</li> <li>7.

By the author of The Volunteer.</p><p>Carter Coleman has written articles for Rolling Stone, Outside, Esquire, Sports Illustrated, Life, and the Los Angeles Times Book Review &amp; Magazine. He graduated from Vanderbilt University and divides his time among New York City, Tennessee, and Tanzania, where he is vice president of the Tanzania Wildlife Fund. This is his first novel.The death of the middle brother in a tight-knit Southern family has a long-lasting effect on older brother Cage and younger brother Harper in this insightful second novel by Coleman (<i>The Volunteer</i>). Nick Rutledge is killed in his mid-20s in 1987, in a head-on car collision. His death devastates everyone&#x2014;his Tennessee minister father, Frank; his mother, Margaret; Cage; and Harper. It's Cage, however, who bears the largest burden of grief and hidden guilt, discovering in the meantime that he's manic-depressive and spiraling into a decade-long bout of drug and alcohol abuse. His parents and grandmother try to give him the support he needs, but it's Harper who repeatedly finds himself cleaning up Cage's messes, even as he pursues a high-powered Wall Street career, drinking and womanizing to distract himself. Coleman writes insightfully and with a minimum of Southern sentimentality as he depicts Cage's illness and the wearying effects it has on everyone around him, and illustrates the sacrifices one makes&#x2014;or doesn't make&#x2014;for the sake of family. Brother Nick leaves little impression on the reader (most of the story takes place in the 1990s, though there are numerous flashbacks to the boys' childhood in the 1960s and 1970s) and at times the mechanics of the plot are a bit visible, but overall this is a good, solid, contemporary Southern novel. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The first fog of the season was as pleasant a surprise as the first snow for children, especially when it was not that nasty yellowish fog you see on certain winter days, but a misty, milky vapour with halos of light in it. The air was fresh. The ends of your fingers and your nose tingled on a day like this, and the soles of your shoes clicked smartly on the road.</p> <p>Hands in the pockets of his large velvet-collared overcoat, famous at Quai des Orf�vres and still smelling slightly of mothballs, his bowler hat well down on his head, Maigret made his way to the Police Judiciaire on foot, at his leisure, and was amused when a girl suddenly shot out of the fog at a run and collided with his dark, solid form.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, I&#x2019;m sorry, sir.&#x2019;</p> <p>And she set off just as fast to catch her bus or M�tro train.</p> <p>It seemed as if all of Paris was enjoying the fog that morning, just like Inspector Maigret, and only the tugboats on the Seine hoarsely announced their uneasiness.</p> <p>A memory was to stick in his mind for no good reason: he had just crossed Place de la Bastille on his way to Boulevard Henri-IV. He was passing a little bistro. The door opened, because it was the first time this season that the chill in the air had made the caf�s close their doors. In passing, Maigret walked through a gust of aromatic air that was, to him, the quintessence of the Parisian dawn: the smell of good white coffee, hot croissants and just a touch of rum. He guessed that behind the steamed-up windows ten, fifteen or twenty customers were sitting at the metal counter, enjoying their first meal of the day before hurrying off to work.</p> <p>At nine o&#x2019;clock precisely, he reached the vaulted entrance of the Police Judiciaire building and climbed the vast and ever-dusty staircase at the same time as several colleagues. As he reached the first floor he automatically glanced through the waiting-room windows and on recognizing C�cile, sitting on one of the chairs upholstered in green velour, he scowled.</p> <p>Or rather, to be absolutely frank, he adopted a deliberately curmudgeonly expression.</p> <p>&#x2018;Hey, Maigret, there she is!&#x2019;</p> <p>The speaker was Cassieux, head of the Drug Squad, coming upstairs just after him. And the joke would go on, just as it always did when C�cile visited the office.</p> <p>Maigret tried to get past without being seen. How long had she been there? She was capable of staying put for hours in the same place, motionless, her hands folded on top of her bag, her ridiculous green hat always tilted slightly sideways on her rather too carefully arranged hair.</p> <p>Of course she spotted the inspector and sprang to her feet. Her mouth opened. She was inaudible because of the glazed partition, but she must be sighing, &#x2018;At last!&#x2019;</p> <p>Shoulders hunched, Maigret hurried to his office at the end of the corridor. The clerk came over to tell him ...</p> <p>&#x2018;I know, I know,&#x2019; growled Maigret. &#x2018;I don&#x2019;t have time at the moment.&#x2019;</p> <p>Because of the fog, he had to switch on the lamp with its green shade on his desk. He took off his overcoat, his hat, looked at the stove, thinking that if it was as chilly as this tomorrow he would ask to have it lit, and then, after rubbing his cold hands together, sat down heavily, with a growl of contentment, and took the telephone off the hook.</p> <p>&#x2018;Hello ... is that the Vieux Normand caf�? ... Will you get me Monsieur Janvier, please? ... Hello, is that you, Janvier?&#x2019;</p> <p>Inspector Janvier would have been sitting in that little caf�-restaurant in Rue Saint-Antoine since seven in the morning, keeping watch on the H�tel des Arcades.</p> <p>&#x2018;Any news?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re all back in the nest, boss. The woman went out half an hour ago to buy bread, butter and a quarter kilo of ground coffee. She&#x2019;s just back.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Is Lucas in position?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;I saw him at the window when I got here.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Right, Jourdan will be along to relieve you. Not too frozen, I hope?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;A bit chilly. Not too bad.&#x2019;</p> <p>Maigret smiled, thinking of the change in Sergeant Lucas, who had transformed himself into a disabled old man four days ago. It was a case of keeping watch on the gang of Poles, five or six of them, who were staying in a squalid room in the squalid H�tel des Arcades. There was no evidence against them, except that one of them, known as the Baron, had paid at the tote on Longchamp racecourse with one of the banknotes stolen from the Vansittart farm.</p> <p>The members of the gang moved around Paris with no obvious purpose, but they met in Rue de Birague, and the central figure there was a young woman; the police hadn&#x2019;t yet worked out whose mistress she was, or what exactly her role was in the gang.</p> <p>At the window of an apartment opposite, muffled up in scarves, Lucas was keeping watch on them from morning to evening in his disguise.</p> <p>Maigret rose to empty his pipe in the coal scuttle. He chose another from the desk, where he kept quite a collection, caught sight of the form that C�cile had filled in and was about to read what she had written, but at that moment a bell rang in the corridor and went on ringing.</p> <p>The briefing! He snatched up the files he had ready and, along with all the other departmental heads, went to the office of the commissioner of the Police Judiciaire. This little ritual took place every morning. The commissioner had long white hair and a goatee beard like a musketeer&#x2019;s. Everyone shook hands.</p> <p>&#x2018;Did you see her?&#x2019;</p> <p>Maigret looked surprised.</p> <p>&#x2018;Who?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;C�cile! Now if I was Madame Maigret ...&#x2019;</p> <p>Poor C�cile! And yet she was still young. Maigret had seen her papers: barely twenty-eight years old. But it would be difficult to look more like an old maid, to move less gracefully, no matter how hard she tried to be pleasing. Those black dresses that she must make for herself from bad paper patterns, that ridiculous green hat! It was impossible to perceive any feminine allure under all that. Her face was too pale, and she had a slight squint into the bargain.</p> <p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s cross-eyed,&#x2019; claimed Inspector Cassieux.</p> <p>He was exaggerating; she wasn&#x2019;t exactly cross-eyed. It was just that her left eye didn&#x2019;t look in quite the same direction as her right eye.</p> <p>She would arrive at eight in the morning, already resigned to her fate. &#x2018;Detective Chief Inspector Maigret, please.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;I don&#x2019;t know if he&#x2019;ll be in this morning. You could see Inspector Berger, who ...&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;No, thank you. I&#x2019;ll wait.&#x2019;</p> <p>And wait she did, all day, without moving, without any sign of impatience, suddenly leaping up, as if she were a prey to emotion, when the inspector came upstairs.</p> <p>&#x2018;I tell you, old friend, she&#x2019;s in love with you.&#x2019;</p> <p>The officers stayed on their feet. They chatted about this and that at first, and then, almost imperceptibly, got down to work.</p> <p>&#x2018;How&#x2019;s the P�lican case going, Cassieux? Any news?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ve called in the manager for ten o&#x2019;clock. He&#x2019;ll have to talk.&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Go carefully, will you? He has a parliamentary deputy protecting him, and I don&#x2019;t want a lot of fuss. What about your Poles, Maigret?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m still waiting. I&#x2019;m planning to investigate their hideout myself tonight. If there&#x2019;s nothing new tomorrow I&#x2019;ll try to have a heart-to-heart with the woman.&#x2019;</p> <p>A nasty bunch. Three crimes committed within six months, all at isolated farms in the north of the country. Coarse, brutal banditry, axe murders ...</p> <p>The fog was turning golden. Electric light wasn&#x2019;t necessary now. The commissioner of the Police Judiciaire drew a file towards him. &#x2018;If you have a moment this morning, Maigret ... here&#x2019;s some research into family interests. A young man of nineteen, the son of a large industrialist, who ...&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Let me have a look.&#x2019;</p> <p>The briefing went on for half an hour, while the air in the room was filled with pipe and cigarette smoke, and was interrupted from time to time by phone calls.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, sir ... certainly, minister.&#x2019;</p> <p>And there was a constant racket of police officers coming and going in the huge corridor, doors opening and closing, telephone conversations in the offices.</p> <p>Maigret, his file under his arm, went back to his own office. He was thinking of the gang of Poles. Automatically, he put the file down on the form that C�cile had filled in. Almost as soon as he was sitting down, the clerk knocked on his door.</p> <p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s about that girl ...&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Are you going to see her?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;In a little while.&#x2019;</p></p><h2>Children&#39;s Literature in Action: A Librarian&#39;s Guide (Library and Information Science Text)</h2><p><p>Looking for a practitioner-oriented intro to literature for children ages 5&#x2013;12?

When we are aware of the various options available in the construction of messages and how they function to produce effects, we have the tools needed to question the messages in artifacts rather than responding uncritically. Sonja Foss, who has an enviable talent for synthesizing complex rhetorical concepts and processes into clear explanations, presents nine methods of rhetorical criticism. She carefully explains and illustrates the theory behind each method with abundant examples of applications. Interesting and lively essays, some written by students, encourage readers to develop their critical skills. Useful bibliographies list additional samples for each type of criticism. Rhetorical criticism is not a process confined to a few assignments in a rhetorical or media criticism course. It is an everyday activity we can use to understand our responses to symbols of all kinds and to create our own symbols to generate the responses we desire.<p> Also by Sonja K.

In the 1930s however, historians began to reappraise the accuracy of this grim portrait. Bruce C. Daniels continues that reappraisal by examining leisure and recreation in colonial and revolutionary New England. He looks closely not only at what New Englanders did from 1620 to 1790, but also at what they said about play, pleasure, and relaxation, thereby placing their deeds and words in the context of an evolving and complex social structure. Daniels's descriptions of leisure and recreational activities do justice to both the intellectual richness of the historical material and to its inherent charm. Chapters on reading, music, civic celebrations, dinner parties, dancing, courtship, sex, alcohol, taverns, sports and games are presented in a lively style designed to make this book as entertaining as it is illuminating. <br><br></p><p>Bruce C.

Representing the collective experience of the authors' decades of experience in law enforcement, training, and teaching, <i>Police Administration 7/e</i> is recognized by both the academic and law enforcement communities as the authoritative treatment of this important topic.&nbsp;</p><p>Thoroughly researched, this edition comprehensively covers the field of police administration and provides a carefully balanced treatment of its procedural, structural, and behavioral aspects.PREFACE <p> The field of police administration is dynamic and ever changing. Laws are modified, new problems occur, and administrative practices that were once accepted as gospel are challenged, modified, and in some cases, discarded. In this edition, as with the previous four editions, we have tried to provide the most current and useful information to the reader in an effort to help them deal with these dynamic forces and the ever-changing environment of police work. </p> <p> Collectively the three authors have been police officers, detectives, administrators, and educators for over eighty years. We have studied, practiced, researched, taught, and consulted on police administration and an inevitable by-product of these experiences is the development of certain perspectives. It is these perspectives that form the rationale for this book. </p> <p> There is much new information in this book the reader will find informative and useful. For example, Chapter Two, Community Policing is a new chapter which focuses on the impact of community policing on police administration. We also discuss the expanded coverage of the Chicago Alternative Policing Strategy (CAPS). In Chapter 3, Politics and Police Administration there is an expanded discussion on the issues of police brutality and scandal as well as discussions of militias, right-wing groups in the United States and school violence. In Chapter 8, Human Resource Management we discuss the arguments presented in favor of requiring a college education for police applicants as well as arguments presented by some groups opposing college education for police applicants. Also in this chapter we have added new material on the Administration of Discipline, Internal Affairs Units, and Retirement Counseling. In Chapter 9, Stress and Police Personnel we have expanded our discussion on police suicide and address in considerable detail the phenomenon known as Suicide by Cop (SbC), Stress and the Female Police Officer and Police Domestic Violence. In Chapter 11, Legal Aspects of Police Administration there is a feature on the now infamous New York City Abner Louima case and its impact along with a discussion of several other high profile cases that have occurred in recent years in New York City. There is also a discussion of a recent Supreme Court decision which limits liability for injuries and deaths associated with high speed police pursuit as well as an update and expanded discussion of sexual harassment in the workplace. In Chapter 12, Planning and Decision Making, we have provided updated material on the investigation of the Branch Davidian Seige in Waco, Texas, focusing on the potential coverup and misuse of military personnel during the engagement. </p> <p> As with all previous editions, we have attempted to provide newspaper clippings, case studies and vignettes from our own experience. These are scattered throughout to illustrate points discussed in the narrative in order to make them more informative and interesting. </p> <p> Finally, the mention of any product or firm in this book is intended for illustrative purposes only and does not necessarily constitute an endorsement or recommendation by the authors or the publisher.</p></p><h2>Gender, Sex, and Politics: In the Streets and Between the Sheets in the 21st Century</h2><p><p><em>Gender, Sex, and Politics: In the Streets and Between the Sheets in the 21st Century</em> includes twenty-seven chapters organized into five sections: Gender, Sexuality and Social Control; Pornography; Sex and Social Media; Dating, Desire, and the Politics of Hooking Up; and Issues in Sexual Pleasure and Safety. This anthology presents these topics using a point-counterpoint-different point framework. Its arguments and perspectives do not pit writers against each other in a binary pro/con debate format. Instead, a variety of views are juxtaposed to encourage critical thinking and robust conversation. This framework enables readers to assess the strengths and shortcomings of conflicting ideas. The chapters are organized in a way that will challenge cherished beliefs and hone both academic and personal insight. <i>Gender, Sex, and Politics </i>is ideal for sparking debates in intro to women&#x2019;s and gender studies, sexuality, and gender courses.</p></p><p><p><strong>Shira Tarrant</strong>, PhD, is Professor of Women&#x2019;s, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at California State University, Long Beach.

These essays, on the other hand, invite us to think and rethink about power, and for the best reason of all: so that we can equalize it. If you care about gender, sex, and politics, this book is for you. </p> <p></p> <p>- Leora Tanenbaum, author of <i>I Am Not a Slut: Slut-Shaming in the Age of the Internet</i></p> <p>This is a must read for academic and practical alike and should be in every college sociology and psychology course.

The book goes on to unveil many truths we must all face. </p> <p>-Kristin Beck, US Navy SEAL, Candidate for US Congress 2016</p> <p>Forty years after the sex wars first captured popular imagination, Shira Tarrant makes it brilliantly clear that sex wars matter anew. In this edgy collection of truth-tellers, contributors invite readers to open their minds, hearts, and conversations. They redefine sexual literacy and challenge the very notion of taboo. Bridging theory, practice, and competing perspectives, the book unsettles and entices. As with the best in gender studies, it&#x2019;s sure to hit a nerve.</p> <p>-Deborah Siegel, PhD, author of <i>Sisterhood, Interrupted: From Radical Women to Grrls Gone Wild</i></p> <p>Tarrant and the 27 contributors show how relevant gender is in our daily lives &#x2015; from online dating to the experience of walking down the street &#x2013; and the format makes each chapter easy to digest and ponder while the discussion questions can help guide either internal debate or a classroom discussion.</p> <p>-HKearl, www.stopstreetharassment.org</p></p><h2>Overruled: The Long War for Control of the U.S. Supreme Court</h2><p><p>Should the Supreme Court defer to the will of the majority and uphold most democratically enacted laws? Or does the Constitution empower the Supreme Court to protect a broad range of individual rights from the reach of lawmakers? In this timely and provocative book, Damon Root traces the long war over judicial activism and judicial restraint from its beginnings in the bloody age of slavery, the Civil War, and Reconstruction to its central role in today's blockbuster legal battles over gay rights, gun control, and health care reform.</p><p>It's a conflict that cuts across the political spectrum in surprising ways and makes for some unusual bedfellows. Judicial deference is not only a touchstone of the Progressive left, for example, it is also a philosophy adopted by many members of the modern right. Today's growing camp of libertarians, however, has no patience with judicial restraint and little use for majority rule. They want the courts and judges to police the other branches of government, and expect Justices to strike down any state or federal law that infringes on their bold constitutional agenda of personal and economic freedom.</p><p><i>Overruled</i> is the story of two competing visions, each one with its own take on what role the government and the courts should play in our society, a fundamental debate that goes to the very heart of our constitutional system.</p></p><p><b>Damon Root</b> is a senior editor at <i>Reason </i>magazine.

It is a core part of the undergraduate math curriculum, and forms part of the training of theoretical physicists and chemical crystallographers. Group theory has tended to be very dry&#x2015;until now. David Joyner uses mathematical toys (primarily the Rubik's Cube and its more modern cousins, the Megaminx, the Pyraminx, and so on) as well as other mathematical examples (e.g., bell ringing) to breathe new life into a time-honored subject.</p><p>"Why," asks the author, "should two such different topics, mechanical puzzles and abstract group theory, be related? This book takes the reader on an intellectual trip to answer this curiosity." <i>Adventures in Group Theory</i> will not only appeal to all math enthusiasts and interested general readers but will also find use in the classroom as a wonderful supplementary text in any abstract algebra or group theory course.</p></p><p>"This is a book on group theory that lives outside the usual rather dry regime of typical mathematics texts.

During the 1930s Garrett Eckbo, Dan Kiley, and JamesRose began to integrate modernist architectural ideas into their work and to design a landscape more in accord with the life and sensibilities of their time. Together with Thomas Church, whose gardens provided the setting for California living, they laid the foundations for a modern American landscape design. This first critical assessment of modem landscape architecture brings together seminal articles from the 1930s and 1940s by Eckbo, Kiley, Rose, Fletcher Steele, and Christopher Tunnard, and includes contributions by contemporary writers and designers such as Peirce Lewis, Catherine Howett, John Dixon Hunt, Peter Walker, and Martha Schwartz who examine the historical and cultural framework within which modern landscape designers have worked.</p><p>There are also essays by Lance Neckar, Reuben Rainey, Gregg Bleam, Michael Laurie, and Marc Treib that discuss the designs and legacy of the Americans Tunnard, Eckbo, Church, Kiley, and Robert Irwin. Doroth�e Imbert takes up Pierre-Emile Legrain and French modernist gardens of the 1920s, and Thorbj�rn Andersson reviews experiments with stylized naturalism developed by Erik Glemme and others in the Stockholm park system.</p></p><p>These twenty-two essay provide a rich forum for assessing the tenets, accomplishments, and limits of modernism in landscape architecture, and for formulating ideas about possible directions for the future of the discipline.

The novel balances a vast cast of intricately enmeshed characters as they react over the course of three tense days in September 1943 to a racial incident on a U.S. Army airbase in Florida. The reader is acutely aware of the war raging abroad and the effect it has had, or will have, on the multitude of servicemen who populate Cozzens's immense canvas. As Noel Perrin commented in The Washington Post Book World: "There is material for two or three hundred movies in Guard of Honor."<br>----"No other American novelist of our time writes with such profound understanding of the wellsprings of human character and of the social pressures that help to form it," said Orville Prescott in The New York Times. As Brendan Gill observed in The New Yorker: "Every page of Guard of Honor gives the impression of a writer at the very top of his powers setting out to accomplish nothing less than his masterwork." <br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-<br>dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hardbound editions of important works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><p><br>"Every major war . . . has produced at least one masterpiece.

G. Perry, 1898<br><br>CHATHAM, MASSACHUSETTS<br>February 18, 1952<br> <br>Boatswain&#x2019;s Mate First Class Bernie Webber held a hot mug of coffee in his large hands as he stared out the foggy window of the mess hall. The cup of mud wasn&#x2019;t half bad. It came from a three-gallon pot and was brewed by mixing the coffee with a couple of eggshells to help the grounds settle at the bottom. The minister&#x2019;s son from Milton, Massachusetts, watched with growing curiosity and concern as the storm continued to strengthen outside. The midwinter nor&#x2019;easter had stalled over New England for the last two days, and Webber wondered if the worst was yet to come. He watched as windswept snow danced over the shifting sands and large drifts piled up alongside the lighthouse tower in the front yard of the Chatham Lifeboat Station. At one time, two lighthouses had stood here; together they were known as the Twin Lights of Chatham. All that remained of the second lighthouse was an old foundation, and on this morning it was completely covered by snow.<br> <br>Taking a sip of his coffee, Webber thought of his young wife, Miriam, home in bed with a bad case of the flu at their cottage on Sea View Street. What if there was an emergency? What if she needed help? Would the doctor be able to reach her in this kind of weather? These questions were fraying his nerves and Webber fought to put them out of his mind. Instead he tried to picture the local fishermen all huddled around the old woodstove at the Chatham Fish Pier. They would be calling for his help soon as their vessels bobbed up and down on the waves in Old Harbor, straining their lines. If the storm is this bad now, what will it be like a few hours from now when it really gets going? he thought.<br> <br>Webber, however, wouldn&#x2019;t complain about the tough day he was facing. The boatswain&#x2019;s mate first class was only twenty-four years old, but he had been working at sea for nearly a decade, having first served with the U.S. Maritime Service during World War II. Webber&#x2019;s three older brothers had also served in the war. Paul, the eldest, had been with the Army&#x2019;s 26th Division in Germany. The so-called Yankee Division had fought in the Battle of the Bulge, joining General George S. Patton&#x2019;s Third Army in capturing the fortified city of Metz. Bob, his next brother, helped protect the homeland with the U.S. Coast Guard. The third, Bill, had helped build the Alaska Highway as a member of the Army Transportation Corps.<br> <br>Bernie had followed his brother Bob into the Coast Guard, but it was not the kind of life his parents had planned for him. From early childhood, Webber&#x2019;s father, the associate pastor at the Tremont Temple Church in Boston, had steered him toward a life in the ministry. The church deacon even paid for Bernie to attend the Mount Hermon School for Boys, located 105 miles away in Gill, Massachusetts, a small town hugging the Connecticut River. Established in 1879, the school boasted prestigious alumni such as Reader&#x2019;s Digest founder DeWitt Wallace and James W. McLamore, who founded Burger King. Needless to say, Bernie was something of an economic outcast amongst the prep school crowd. He arrived at Mount Hermon carrying serious doubts and wearing his brother&#x2019;s hand-me-down clothes. He was not a strong student and he privately questioned why he was there. Webber knew in his heart that he did not want to follow in his father&#x2019;s footsteps. He was thinking about running away from school when fate intervened; a childhood friend who had crashed his father&#x2019;s car came looking for a place to hide out. Webber obliged his buddy&#x2019;s request, ensconcing him in one of the dorm rooms and swiping food from the school cafeteria for him to eat. The two were caught after just a few days but they didn&#x2019;t stick around long enough to face the consequences. Instead they fled to the hills and cornfields surrounding the school and eventually made it back to Milton.<br> <br>The Reverend Bernard A. Webber struggled to understand the actions of his wayward son as young Bernie quit school and continued to drift. A year later, at the age of sixteen, Bernie got an idea that would change the course of his rudderless life. He heard that the U.S. Maritime Service was looking for young men like him for training in New York. If Bernie could complete the arduous training camp, he could then serve the war effort on a merchant ship. After his father reluctantly signed his enlistment papers, he quickly joined up and was schooled on the fundamentals of seamanship at the U.S. Maritime Service Training Station in Sheepshead Bay, New York, where he also received training from former world heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey, then serving as a commander in the Coast Guard as well as the athletic instructor at the training station. When he was finished, Webber shipped out on the SS Sinclair Rubiline, a T2 oil tanker that ran gasoline from ports in Aruba and Curacao to American warships of the U.S. Third Fleet in the South Pacific. During this time, the young man realized that he would not spend his life in the ministry or any other job on dry land. Bernie Webber had been born to the sea. He enlisted in the U.S. Coast Guard on February 26, 1946, and was sent to its training station at Curtis Bay, Maryland. In letters to recruits at the time, the commanding officer of the Coast Guard training station summed up the life and duty of a Coast Guardsman this way:<br><br>Hard jobs are routine in this service. In a way, the Coast Guard is always at war; in wartime, against armed enemies of the nation; and in peacetime, against all enemies of mankind at sea; Fire, Collision, Lawlessness, Gales, Ice, Derelicts, and many more. The Coast Guard, therefore, is no place for a quitter, or for a crybaby, or for a lying four-flusher, or anyone who cannot keep his eye on the ball. Your period of recruit training is a time of a test, hour by hour and day by day, to determine whether or not you are made of the right material. It is up to you, as an individual to prove your worth.<br><br>Webber was now on duty in Chatham, a tiny outpost at the elbow of Cape Cod. His worth and his mettle had already been tested many times in the unforgiving waters off the Cape. It was one of the busiest and most dangerous places for anyone who made their living on the sea. The director of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey made a point of this way back in 1869. &#x201c;There is no other place in the world, perhaps,&#x201d; he wrote about the waters off Cape Cod, &#x201c;where tides of such very small rise and fall are accompanied by such strong currents running far out to sea.&#x201d; In fact, seamen referred to the area as &#x201c;the graveyard of the Atlantic,&#x201d; and for good reason. The sunken skeletons of more than three thousand shipwrecks were scattered across the ocean floor from Chatham to Provincetown. The first known wreck was the Sparrowhawk, which ran aground on December 17, 1626, in Orleans. The crew, along with colonists bound for Virginia, managed to get to shore safely, and the vessel was repaired. But before it could hoist its sails again, another devastating ocean storm came along and sunk the Sparrowhawk for good. The episode was detailed by Governor William Bradford in his diary of the Plymouth Colony. Two hundred years later, erosion brought the wreckage into view in a mud bank along the Orleans coastline. The famous HMS Somerset also met her fate in the treacherous waters off Cape Cod. The ship, immortalized in Longfellow&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;The Midnight Ride of Paul Revere,&#x201d; was wrecked in the shoals off Truro during a violent gale on November 3, 1778. Twenty-one British officers and seamen drowned when their lifeboat overturned coming ashore. The ship&#x2019;s captain, George Ourry, surrendered to Truro selectman Isaiah Atkins on behalf of his 480-man crew. The survivors were taken as prisoners of war and were then marched to Boston, escorted by town militias along the way. (Paul Revere, who had once rowed stealthily past the Somerset to alert Lexington and Concord of the British invasion, was later given the ship&#x2019;s sixty-four guns to help fortify Castle Island in Boston Harbor.) As author Henry C. Kittredge observed in Cape Cod: Its People &amp; Their History (1930), &#x201c;If all the wrecks which have been piled upon the back-side of Cape Cod were placed bow to stern, they would make a continuous wall from Chatham to Provincetown.&#x201d;<br> <br>Bernie Webber&#x2019;s baptism under fire had come during an evening in 1949 when he responded to his first distress call at the Chatham Lifeboat Station. The Gleaves-class destroyer USS Livermore had run aground on Bearse&#x2019;s Shoal, off Monomoy Island. Luck had sailed with the Livermore up to that point. Her crew had managed to dodge Nazi U-boat wolfpacks while escorting convoys to Iceland bound for England in the months before the United States entered World War II. On November 9, 1942, the destroyer took part in the Allied invasion of North Africa, providing antisubmarine, antiaircraft, and fire support off Mehdia, French Morocco. The Livermore had survived the war relatively unscathed, a fact that some of her crew members ascribed to the fact that she was the first American warship to be named after a Navy chaplain, Samuel Livermore.<br> <br>First Class Boatswain Mate Leo Gracie took Webber and a crew on a 38-foot Coast Guard picket boat over the treacherous Chatham Bar to where the Livermore lay with a Naval Reserve crew stranded on board. The ship rested high up on the shoal and was leaning dangerously on its side. Webber and the men stayed with the destroyer for the rest of the night as salvage tugs were called in. The next morning, the Coast Guardsmen assisted in several failed attempts to free the warship before finally achieving success and sending the Livermore safely on its way. Webber smiled as the Livermore&#x2019;s crew cheered him and his crew. The sailors had given him quite a different reception hours earlier when they pelted him with apples, oranges, and even eight-ounce steel shackles, because in their eyes the rescue mission was taking too long. It was all part of a friendly rivalry between the Navy and the Coasties. The Naval Reserve crew was no doubt a little embarrassed that its rescue came at the hands of the Coast Guard, or the Hooligan&#x2019;s Navy as they called it.<br> <br>Yes, the life of a Coast Guardsman was often a thankless one, but Webber would not trade it for any other job in the world. And now, just after dawn, he gazed out the window of the mess hall, listened to the wind howl, and wondered what the day would bring.</p><h2>Female Power and Male Dominance: On the Origins of Sexual Inequality</h2><p>In this book, Professor Peggy Sanday provides a ground-breaking examination of power and dominance in male-female relationships. How does the culturally approved interaction between the sexes originate? Why are women viewed as a necessary part of political, economic, and religious affairs in some societies but not in others? Why do some societies clothe sacred symbols of creative power in the guise of one sex and not of the other? Professor Sanday offers solutions to these cultural puzzles by using cross-cultural research on over 150 tribal societies. She systematically establishes the full range of variation in male and female power roles and then suggests a theoretical framework for explaining this variation. Rejecting the argument of universal female subordination, Professor Sanday argues that male dominance is not inherent in human relations but is a solution to various kinds of cultural strain. Those who are thought to embody, be in touch with, or control the creative forces of nature are perceived as powerful. In isolating the behavioural and symbolic mechanisms which institute male dominance, professor Sanday shows that a people&#39;s secular power roles are partly derived from ancient concepts of power, as exemplified by their origin myths. Power and dominance are further determined by a people&#39;s adaptation to their environment, social conflict, and emotional stress. This is illustrated through case studies of the effects of European colonialism, migration, and food stress, and supported by numerous statistical associations between sexual inequity and various cultural stresses.</p><p>Applying data from over 150 tribal societies to scales developed to measure power and dominance, Sanday offers answers to basic questions regarding male and female power. The view that emerges conforms to no particular theoretical perspective.Peggy Reeves Sanday is Professor of Anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania. She is the author of many books, including A Woman Scorned: Acquaintance Rape on Trial and, most recently, Women at the Center: Life in a Modern Matriarchy.</p><h2>A History of Pagan Europe</h2><p><p>The first comprehensive study of its kind, this fully&nbsp;illustrated&nbsp;book establishes Paganism as a persistent force in European history with a profound influence on modern thinking. </p> <p>From the serpent goddesses of ancient Crete to modern nature-worship and the restoration of the indigenous religions of eastern Europe, this wide-ranging book offers a rewarding new perspective of European history. </p> <p>In this definitive study, Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick draw together the fragmented sources of Europe's native religions and establish the coherence and continuity of the Pagan world vision.

Jones and Pennick trace the evolution of Pagan religions in Greece and Rome, the religions of the Celts, Paganism in Germany and the Balkans, and the current Pagan revival. Filled with concise information and illustrations which add to the content rather than distracting from it, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll be referring to this book again in the future.In this definitive study, Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick draw together the fragmented sources of Europe&#39;s native religions and establish the coherence and continuity of the Pagan world vision. Challenging a traditional, Christian perspective of history, the authors argue that the modern world owes to ancient Paganism its pluralistic tolerance, its love of the arts and its respect for empirical method. Exploring Paganism as it developed from the ancient world, through the Celtic and Germanic periods, the authors finally appraise modern Paganism and its apparent causes. Feminist spirituality, the heritage movement, nature-worship and &#39;deep&#39; ecology are some of the modern preoccupations which benefit from being examined within the wider context of European Paganism.</p><h2>Killing Lincoln: The Shocking Assassination that Changed America Forever (Bill O&#39;Reilly&#39;s Killing Series)</h2><p><p><b>A riveting historical narrative of the heart-stopping events surrounding the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, and the first work of history from mega-bestselling author Bill O'Reilly</b></p><p>The iconic anchor of <i>The O'Reilly Factor</i> recounts one of the most dramatic stories in American history&#x2015;how one gunshot changed the country forever. In the spring of 1865, the bloody saga of America's Civil War finally comes to an end after a series of increasingly harrowing battles. President Abraham Lincoln's generous terms for Robert E. Lee's surrender are devised to fulfill Lincoln's dream of healing a divided nation, with the former Confederates allowed to reintegrate into American society. But one man and his band of murderous accomplices, perhaps reaching into the highest ranks of the U.S. government, are not appeased.</p><p>In the midst of the patriotic celebrations in Washington D.C., John Wilkes Booth&#x2015;charismatic ladies' man and impenitent racist&#x2015;murders Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre. A furious manhunt ensues and Booth immediately becomes the country's most wanted fugitive. Lafayette C. Baker, a smart but shifty New York detective and former Union spy, unravels the string of clues leading to Booth, while federal forces track his accomplices. The thrilling chase ends in a fiery shootout and a series of court-ordered executions&#x2015;including that of the first woman ever executed by the U.S. government, Mary Surratt.

And I have no doubt that they will do it." </p><p>The two men are walking down Pennsylvania Avenue, on their way back to the War Department for their second meeting of the day. Lincoln wants a short session with Stanton to discuss the fate of a Confederate ringleader who very recently made the mistake of crossing the border from Canada back into the United States. Stanton is in favor of arresting the man, while Lincoln prefers to let him slip away to England on the morning steamer. As soon as Lincoln makes his point, he aims to hurry back to the White House for the carriage ride he promised Mary. </p><p>William Crook is fond of the president and deeply unsettled by the comments. </p><p>"Why do you think so, Mr. President?" </p><p>Crook steps forward as they come upon a group of angry drunks. He puts his body between theirs and Lincoln's, thus clearing the way for the president's safe passage. Crook's actions, while brave, are unnecessary&#x2014;if the drunks realize that the president of the United States is sharing the same sidewalk, they give no notice. </p><p>Lincoln waits until Crook is beside him again, then continues his train of thought. "Other men have been assassinated," Lincoln says. </p><p>"I hope you are mistaken, Mr. President." </p><p>"I have perfect confidence in those around me. In every one of you men. I know that no one could do it and escape alive," Lincoln says. The two men walk in silence before he finishes his thought: "But if it is to be done, it is impossible to prevent it." </p><p>At the War Department, Lincoln once again invites Stanton and telegraph chief Major Thomas Eckert, the man who can break fireplace pokers over his arms, to attend Our American Cousin that night. Both men turn him down once again. Lincoln is upset by their rejection, but he doesn't show it outwardly. The only indication comes on the walk back to the White House, when he admits to Crook, "I do not want to go." Lincoln says it like a man facing a death sentence. </p><p>Inside the White House, Lincoln is pulled into an unscheduled last-minute meeting that will delay his carriage ride. Lincoln hides his exasperation and dutifully meets with New Hampshire congressman Edward H. Rollins. But as soon as Rollins leaves, yet another petitioner begs a few minutes of Lincoln's time. A weary Lincoln, all too aware that Mary will be most upset if he keeps her waiting much longer, gives former military aide Colonel William Coggeshall the benefit of a few moments. </p><p>Finally, Lincoln marches down the stairs and heads for the carriage. He notices a one-armed soldier standing off to one side of the hallway and overhears the young man tell another, "I would almost give my other hand if I could shake that of Lincoln." </p><p>Lincoln can't resist. "You shall do that and it shall cost you nothing, boy," he exclaims, smiling broadly as he walks over and grasps the young man's hand. He asks his name, that of his regiment, and in which battle he lost the arm. </p><p>Only then does Lincoln say his farewells and step outside. He finds Mary waiting at the carriage. She's in a tentative mood&#x2014;they've spent so little time alone in the past few months that being together, just the two of them, feels strange. She wonders if Lincoln might be more comfortable if they brought some friends along for the open-air ride. </p><p>"I prefer to ride by ourselves today," he insists. Lincoln helps her into the barouche and then is helped up from the gravel driveway to take his seat beside her. The four-wheeled horse-drawn carriage features two facing double seats for passengers and a retractable roof. The driver sits in a box seat up front. Lincoln opts to keep the roof open, then covers their laps with a blanket, even though the temperature is a warm sixty-eight degrees. </p><p>The war has been hard on their marriage. Mary is delighted beyond words to see that Lincoln is in a lighthearted mood. She gazes into her husband's eyes and recognizes the man who once courted her. </p><p>"Dear Husband," she laughs, "you startle me by your great cheerfulness. I have not seen you so happy since before Willie's death." </p><p>"And well I may feel so, Mary. I consider this day, the war has come to a close." The president pauses. "We must both be more cheerful in the future&#x2014;between the war and the loss of our darling Willie we have been very miserable." </p><p>Coachman Francis Burns guides the elegant pair of black horses down G Street. The pace is a quick trot. Behind them ride two cavalry escorts, just for safety. The citizens of Washington are startled to see the Lincolns out on the town. They hear loud laughter from Mary as the barouche passes by and see a grin spread across the president's face. When a group calls out to him as the carriage turns onto New Jersey Avenue, he doffs his trademark stovepipe hat in greeting. </p>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;<p></p><p>Throughout the war, Lincoln has stayed in the moment, never allowing himself to dream of the future. But now he pours his heart out to Mary, talking about a proposed family trip to Palestine, for he is most curious about the Holy Land. And after he leaves office he wants the family to return to their roots in Illinois, where he will once again hang out his shingle as a country lawyer. The "Lincoln &amp; Herndon" sign has never been taken down, at Lincoln's specific request to his partner. </p><p>"Mary," Lincoln says, "we have had a hard time of it since we came to Washington, but the war is over, and with God's blessing we may hope for four years of peace and happiness, and then we will go back to Illinois and pass the rest of our lives in quiet. We have laid by some money, and during this term we will try to save up more." </p><p>The carriage makes its way to the Navy Yard, where Lincoln steps on board USS Montauk. His intent is just a cursory peek at the storied ironclad, with its massive round turret constituting the deck's superstructure. But soon its crew mobs Lincoln, and he is forced to politely excuse himself so that he can return to Mary. Unbeknownst to Lincoln, the Montauk will soon serve another purpose. </p><p>Lincoln offers a final salute to the many admirers as coachman Burns turns the carriage back toward the White House. It's getting late, and the Lincolns have to be at the theater. </p><p>John Wilkes Booth is expecting them. <br></p><p><br>Copyright � 2011 by Bill O'Reilly</p></p><h2>Dividing Lines: The Politics of Immigration Control in America (Princeton Studies in American Politics: Historical, International, and Comparative Perspectives, 104)</h2><p><p>Immigration is perhaps the most enduring and elemental leitmotif of America. This book is the most powerful study to date of the politics and policies it has inspired, from the founders' earliest efforts to shape American identity to today's revealing struggles over Third World immigration, noncitizen rights, and illegal aliens. Weaving a robust new theoretical approach into a sweeping history, Daniel Tichenor ties together previous studies' idiosyncratic explanations for particular, pivotal twists and turns of immigration policy. He tells the story of lively political battles between immigration defenders and doubters over time and of the transformative policy regimes they built.</p><br><p> Tichenor takes us from vibrant nineteenth-century politics that propelled expansive European admissions and Chinese exclusion to the draconian restrictions that had taken hold by the 1920s, including racist quotas that later hampered the rescue of Jews from the Holocaust. American global leadership and interest group politics in the decades after World War II, he argues, led to a surprising expansion of immigration opportunities. In the 1990s, a surge of restrictionist fervor spurred the political mobilization of recent immigrants. Richly documented, this pathbreaking work shows that a small number of interlocking temporal processes, not least changing institutional opportunities and constraints, underlie the turning tides of immigration sentiments and policy regimes. Complementing a dynamic narrative with a host of helpful tables and timelines, Dividing Lines is the definitive treatment of a phenomenon that has profoundly shaped the character of American nationhood.</p></p><p><p>"Daniel Tichenor's <i>Dividing Lines</i> is one of the best books on U.S. immigration policy to appear in the past decade. Political scientists, sociologists, historians, and nonacademic readers will all find it illuminating."<b>--Martin Shefter, Cornell University</b></p><p>"This is an excellent book. It constitutes a superb narrative history of American immigration policy and reform, makes sense of the trajectory of this development, and connects the politics and history of immigration reform to a set of larger theoretical claims in the field of American political development. It thus makes a number of important contributions, not only to immigration history but also to American political development and the historical-institutional study of politics generally."<b>--Robert C.

Why? Because the <i>American Heritage</i> is a long-standing favorite family dictionary (never underestimate the value of pictures) and one of the prime dictionary references for magazines, newspapers, and dot.com content providers. For scads of writers and editors across the U.S., it sets the standard on matters of style and lexicographical authority.<p> So this new edition is exciting and noteworthy, but how good is it? In its favor, the fourth edition is as current a dictionary as you can get. It's six years fresher than the 1994 version, with 10,000 words and definitions you won't find in the still venerable but now slightly dated third edition. For example, unlike its predecessor (and also unlike the 1996 <i>Oxford Encyclopedic English Dictionary</i>), this fourth edition covers <i>dot-com</i>, <i>e-commerce</i>, and <i>soccer mom</i>, <i>Ebonics</i>, <i>Viagra</i>, and a <i>surf</i> definition for cruising television channels and the Internet.</p><p> Its panel of special consultants includes authorities on anthropology, architecture, cinema, and law, plus military science, music, religion, and sports, and that is reflected in an impressively comprehensive coverage of the arts, culture, and technology. Sadly, however, there are no medical consultants on the panel, and that loss is felt in some substandard medical definitions. Other flaws: there's a greater than usual tendency to define a word with a form of the same word--for example, <i>fuzzy</i>, whose first two definitions are "1. covered with fuzz." and "2. of or resembling fuzz." And some definitions seem needlessly wordy, such as the entry for <i>furious</i>, which is "full of or characterized by extreme anger; raging." Compare that with the more succinct <i>Oxford Encyclopedic</i> entry: "1. extremely angry. 2. full of fury."</p><p> On the other hand, there are valuable entries throughout the dictionary supplying additional information on synonyms, usage, or word history, and these extras, such as the history of <i>diatribe</i> and the usage notes on <i>discomfit</i>, are interesting. The layout is easy on the eyes, with dark blue/green bold type setting the words apart from their definitions, and 4,000 color photographs, maps, and illustrations that are both useful and delightful. On one page, the margin provides color depictions of Francis Bacon, bacterium, and a Bactrian camel. Theodore Roosevelt and a rooster share another margin, while a third page offers Isak Dinesen, a dingo, and dinoflagellate.

Every person alive today is descended from him. How did this real-life Adam wind up father of us all? What happened to the descendants of other men who lived at the same time? And why, if modern humans share a single prehistoric ancestor, do we come in so many sizes, shapes, and races?</p><br><p> Showing how the secrets about our ancestors are hidden in our genetic code, Spencer Wells reveals how developments in the cutting-edge science of population genetics have made it possible to create a family tree for the whole of humanity. We now know not only where our ancestors lived but who they fought, loved, and influenced.</p><br><p> Informed by this new science, <i>The Journey of Man</i> is replete with astonishing information. Wells tells us that we can trace our origins back to a single Adam and Eve, but that Eve came first by some 80,000 years. We hear how the male Y-chromosome has been used to trace the spread of humanity from Africa into Eurasia, why differing racial types emerged when mountain ranges split population groups, and that the San Bushmen of the Kalahari have some of the oldest genetic markers in the world. We learn, finally with absolute certainty, that Neanderthals are not our ancestors and that the entire genetic diversity of Native Americans can be accounted for by just ten individuals.</p><br><p> It is an enthralling, epic tour through the history and development of early humankind--as well as an accessible look at the analysis of human genetics that is giving us definitive answers to questions we have asked for centuries, questions now more compelling than ever.</p></p><p>Spencer Wells traces human evolution back to our very first ancestor in <i>The Journey of Man</i>. Along the way, he sums up the explosive effect of new techniques in genetics on the field of evolutionary biology and all available evidence from the fossil record. Wells's seemingly sexist title is purposeful: he argues that the Y chromosome gives us a unique opportunity to follow our migratory heritage back to a sort of Adam, just as earlier work in mitochondrial DNA allowed the identification of Eve, mother of all <i>Homo sapiens</i>. While his descriptions of the advances made by such luminary scientists as Richard Lewontin and Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza can be dry, Wells comes through with sparkling metaphors when it counts, as when he compares genetic drift to a bouillabaisse recipe handed down through a village's generations. Though finding our primal male is an exciting prospect, the real revolution Wells describes is racial. Or rather, nonracial, as he reiterates the scientific truth that our notions of what makes us different from each other are purely cultural, not based in biology. The case for an "out of Africa" scenario of human migration is solid in this book, though Wells makes it clear when he is hypothesizing anything controversial. Readers interested in a fairly technical, but not overwhelming, summary of the remarkable conclusions of 21st-century human evolutionary biology will find <i>The Journey of Man</i> a perfect primer. <i>--Therese Littleton</i><p>"Written with much verve, easy to read, and up-to-date on many important developments."<b>--Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza, Stanford University, author of <i>The History and Geography of Human Genes</i> and <i>Genes, Peoples, and Languages</i>.</b></p><p>"Spencer Wells, whose genetic work has contributed to our understanding of human prehistory, has provided the lay reader with an account of the spread and mixing of the human species from its origin in Africa that is both scientifically accurate and accessible to the nonscientist. In achieving that accessibility, he has not made the common error of confusing simple explanations with simplistic ones. Most important, Wells has the intellectual integrity, all too rare in popularizations of science, to distinguish what is really known from what is only speculation."<b>--Richard Lewontin, Harvard University, author of <i>It Ain't Necessarily So: The Dream of the Human Genome and Other Illusions</i>.</b></p></p><h2>Monster Calls</h2><p>The bestselling novel and major film about love, loss and hope from the twice Carnegie Medal-winning Patrick Ness. Conor has the same dream every night, ever since his mother first fell ill, ever since she started the treatments that don&#39;t quite seem to be working. But tonight is different. Tonight, when he wakes, there&#39;s a visitor at his window. It&#39;s ancient, elemental, a force of nature. And it wants the most dangerous thing of all from Conor. It wants the truth. Patrick Ness takes the final idea of the late, award-winning writer Siobhan Dowd and weaves an extraordinary and heartbreaking tale of mischief, healing and above all, the courage it takes to survive.</p><p>Patrick Ness is the author of the award-winning and best-selling Chaos Walking trilogy and the critically-acclaimed novels More Than This and The Rest of Us Just Live Here. John Green has described him as &#34;an insanely beautiful writer&#34;. He has won every major prize in children&#39;s fiction, including the Carnegie Medal twice. He lives in London.This award-winning, uncompromising novel is a valuable read for older children struggling to understand life&#39;s unavoidable trials. * Time Out * Powerfully felt, this is stylistically Ness&#39;s book, but communicates Dowd-like wisdom. Both realistic and magical, it is a fable about the complexity of our emotions, giving us permission to feel anger and illuminating the nature of loss. -- Nicolette Jones * The Sunday Times * A Monster Calls takes Dowd&#39;s preliminary idea, and draws out of that bud a tale that has nothing of the hybrid about it. Received wisdom dictates that books published for children need endings that are, if not exactly happy, then at least hopeful. A happy ending would have been a betrayal of the kind of bracingly honest book this is, but hope can be hard to come by in such a story. Here the desperate honesty and refusal to compromise do allow for a sort of brutal clarity to emerge, and from that finally a glimpse of something like hope. Brave and beautiful, full of compassion, A Monster Calls fuses the painful and insightful, the simple and profound. The result trembles with life. -- Daniel Hahn * Independent * Award-winning writer Siobhan Dowd died of cancer before she could write this book, but the choice of Patrick Ness (Chaos Walking Trilogy) to take her idea and create this heartbreaking story was inspired. It is an intensely raw but emotionally rewarding rite-of-passage for young teenager Conor, whose divorced mum is dying of cancer. Using folklore stories to illustrate that good and bad are all part of the whole, the tree monster drags the reluctant Conor to confront his own demons and, in doing so, to face the future. The conclusion is brave, honest and a huge release. [...] this haunting and demanding book shines with compassion, insight and flashes of humour and is a collaboration that highlights the exceptional talents of Ness, Dowd and Kay. A worthy tribute. -- Sally Morris * Daily Mail * Electrifying and hugely readable, it feels like a genuine act of authorial kindness when the gut-wrenching ending conveys a glimmer of redemption. * Daily Telegraph * definitely one of my favourite books of the year * Guardian, Malorie Blackman *</p><h2>Straight A&#39;s in Medical-Surgical Nursing</h2><p>This easy-to-read outline review follows the unique two-column <b>Straight A's</b> format that lets students choose how they study for NCLEX� and course exams.

As new theories in family therapy rapidly emerge, these case studies examine the gamut of therapy models, including Solution-Focused Therapy, Collaborative Language Systems, and Narrative Theory. The Casebook also examines the increasing number of integrative approaches that blend together various existing therapy models based on empirical research and practical experience. This integrative coverage reflects the greater convergence, conceptually and technically, of distinct theories of family therapy. The diverse scope of authors contributing to the Casebook all have extensive clinical and empirical experience with their selected theory, and some have had an affiliation with the major training center where specific theories have evolved. To bring their areas of expertise into the students&#39; realm, contributing authors include extensive verbatims and commentaries that detail how the theories are implemented.

Nearby, his father, an eminent author, taught on a college campus and took the kids out on Sundays. The clash between town and gown, between the hard drinking, drugging, and fighting of "townies" and the ambitions of students debating books and ideas, couldn&#x2019;t have been more stark. In this unforgettable memoir, acclaimed novelist Dubus shows us how he escaped the cycle of violence and found empathy in channeling the stories of others&#x2015;bridging, in the process, the rift between his father and himself.</p></p><p><strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, February 2011</strong>: Rarely has the process of becoming a writer seemed as organic and--dare I say it--moral as it does in Andre Dubus III's clear-eyed and compassionate memoir, <em>Townie</em>. You might think that following his father's trade would have been natural and even obvious for the son and namesake of Andre Dubus, one of the most admired short story writers of his time, but it was anything but. His father left when he was 10, and as his mother worked long hours to keep them fed, her four children mostly raised themselves, stumbling through house parties and street fights in their Massachusetts mill town, so cut off from the larger world that when someone mentioned "Manhattan" when Andre was in college he didn't know what they were talking about. What he did know, and what he recalls with detailed intensity, were the battles in bars and front yards, brutal to men and women alike, that first gave him discipline, as he built himself from a fearful kid into a first-punch, hair-trigger bruiser, and then empathy, as, miraculously, he pulled himself back from the violence that threatened to define him. And it was out of that empathy that, wanting to understand the stories of the victims of brutality as well as those whose pain drove them to dish it out, he began to write, reconciling with his father and eventually giving us novels like <em>House of Sand and Fog</em> and now this powerful and big-hearted memoir. <em>--Tom Nissley</em>Andre Dubus III is the author of Gone So Long, Dirty Love, The Garden of Last Days, House of Sand and Fog (a #1 New York Times bestseller, Oprah&#x2019;s Book Club pick, and finalist for the National Book Award), and Townie, winner of an American Academy of Arts and Letters Award in Literature. His writing has received many honors, including a Guggenheim Fellowship, a National Magazine Award, and two Pushcart Prizes. He lives with his family north of Boston.</p><h2>One of Us: Conjoined Twins and the Future of Normal</h2><p><p> Must children born with socially challenging anatomies have their bodies changed because others cannot be expected to change their minds? <i>One of Us</i> views conjoined twinning and other "abnormalities" from the point of view of people living with such anatomies, and considers these issues within the larger historical context of anatomical politics. Anatomy matters, Alice Domurat Dreger tells us, because the senses we possess, the muscles we control, and the resources we require to keep our bodies alive limit and guide what we experience in any given context. Her deeply thought-provoking and compassionate work exposes the breadth and depth of that context--the extent of the social frame upon which we construct the "normal." In doing so, the book calls into question assumptions about anatomy and normality, and transforms our understanding of how we are all intricately and inextricably joined. </p></p><p><b>Alice Domurat Dreger</b> is Visiting Associate Professor in Medical Humanities and Bioethics in the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University and Director of Medical Education at the Intersex Society of North America.Providing historical and contemporary evidence that most adult conjoined twins do not desire to be separated, and that many surgeries are carried out on children too young to object, Domurat Dreger voices distaste for Americans' failure to tolerate anatomical difference and instead fetishize individualism at all cost...This pithily provocative critique of medical paternalism and society's blind spot vis-�-vis anatomical standards provides a valuable opportunity to ponder the high-profile surgeries on conjoined twins that most of us know only through the news headlines we habitually fail to question. (<i>Publishers Weekly</i> 2004-01-26)<br><br>Part history of medicine, part consciousness-raising freak show, this surprisingly entertaining book examines cultural reactions to conjoined twins and other anatomical anomalies. Dreger argues that Victorians were more appreciative than moderns of people born 'different,' viewing them as 'authorities on a unique and strangely attractive experience.' Nowadays, pediatric surgeons so prize normalcy that they perform sexual surgery on infants without concern for adult function; they may also withhold information from parents, and even override their consent, when dealing with birth defects...[H]er examples persuasively make the case that the anatomically different feel normal to themselves. (<i>New Yorker</i> 2004-04-12)<br><br>In this thoughtful and provocative examination of conjoined twins and other unusual anatomies, Dreger argues that the medically invasive, almost invariably life-threatening separation surgeries are unnecessary and performed, usually, before the people involved are old enough to consent to them. She claims that, historically, most conjoined twins have preferred conjoinment to life as singletons, as Dreger calls those who aren't conjoined. Rather than changing conjoined twins so that the rest of us can fit them into our construction of normal human anatomy, Dreger believes singletons ought to expand their understanding of anatomical normality to include conjoined twins--and people with cleft lips, intersex genitalia, and other unusual anatomical features. (John Green <i>Booklist</i> 2004-03-15)<br><br>[Dreger] questions whether difference has to be viewed as an impairment and whether impairment is tragic...Disability arises not from the impairment but from the response to it in those around, and so is socially induced...Dreger makes no claim to know all the answers but, by taking their side so eloquently, she invites us to see conjoined twins as 'no more broken than the rest of us.' This book is an eloquent and humane plea to see conjoined twins, and others with impairment and disability, as 'us' and not 'them.' (Jonathan Cole <i>Nature</i> 2004-05-06)<br><br>Conjoined twins serve as a metaphor for fundamental truths about what it is to be human. Much of the book's power, much of its importance, derives from the ways in which the stories it tells resonate with the lives of those who are neither conjoined nor intersexual...Let's hope the publication of this book leads to...a serious rethinking of all our rights to consent to treatment, to privacy and autonomy, and to life itself. It is because this book has something important to say to 'normates' about their own lives, as well as about the lives of conjoined twins, that it stands a real chance of changing how we think about those with atypical anatomies. (David Wootton <i>London Review of Books</i> 2004-07-22)<br><br>Alice Dreger brims with concern about social attitudes towards people who don't fit the stereotype of what is 'normal' and how this is reflected in deformities in general and conjoinedness in particular. If we look beyond her message--that concepts of 'normality' are paradoxically both flexible and rigid (to suit a range of prejudices), notoriously artificial and therefore undesirable--we see she has a point. With copious references, she shows that many sets of joined twins were content with their duplex identity, caring deeply about each other and accommodating their often striking psychological and intellectual differences with an intimacy we singletons can hardly imagine. (Bob Rickard <i>Fortean Times</i>)<br><br>Dreger has written a book that is insightful, compassionate, critical, and interesting. She shows how understanding the history of medicine is essential for critically developing current ethical medical protocols and reconstructing what is taken to be normal. (N. A. McHugh <i>Choice</i> 2004-11-01)<br><br>Challenging widely held assumptions is never easy, but that is exactly what Alice Dreger does in this thought provoking and compassionate book...Dreger suggests that raising the political consciousness of all those with unusual anatomies will benefit them and help shift societal attitudes towards acceptance and integration rather than 'normalisation.' This discussion will become increasingly important as medical techniques offer more sophisticated means of detecting, eliminating or treating the 'abnormal.' (<i>Bulletin of Medical Ethics</i> 2004-11-01)</p><h2>Numerical Methods Using Matlab</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book provides a fundamental introduction to numerical analysis. <b> </b>This book covers numerous topics including Interpolation and Polynomial Approximation, Curve Fitting, Numerical Differentiation, Numerical Integration, and Numerical Optimization. <b> </b>For engineering and computer science fields. </p></p><p><p> This book provides a fundamental introduction to numerical analysis suitable for undergraduate students in mathematics, computer science, physical sciences, and engineering. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with calculus and has taken a structured programming course. The text has enough material fitted modularly for either a single-term course or a year sequence. In short, the book contains enough material so that instructors will be able to select topics appropriate to their needs. </p> <p> Students of various backgrounds should find numerical methods quite interesting and useful, and this is kept in mind throughout the book. Thus, there is a wide variety of examples and problems that help to sharpen one's skill in both the theory and practice of numerical analysis. Computer calculations are presented in the form of tables and graphs whenever possible so that the resulting numerical approximations are easier to visualize and interpret. MATLAB programs are the vehicle for presenting the underlying numerical algorithms. </p> <p> Emphasis is placed on understanding why numerical methods work and their limitations. This is challenging and involves a balance between theory, error analysis, and readability. An error analysis for each method is presented in a fashion that is appropriate for the method at hand, yet does not turn off the reader. A mathematical derivation for each method is given that uses elementary results and builds the student's understanding of calculus. Computer assignments using MATLAB give students an opportunity to practice their skills at scientific programming. </p> <p> Shorter numerical exercises can be carried out with a pocket calculator/computer, and the longer ones can be done using MATLAB subroutinie libraries. It is left for the instructor to guide the students regarding the pedagogical use of numerical computations. Each instructor can make assignments that are appropriate to the available computing resources. Experimentation with the MATLAB subroutine libraries is encouraged. These materials can be used to assist students in the completion of the numerical analysis component of computer laboratory exercises. </p> In this edition a section on Bezier curves has been added to the end of the chapter on curve fitting. Additionally, the chapter on numerical optimization has been expanded to include an introduction to both direct and derivative based methods for optimizing functions of one or more variables. A listing of the MATLAB programs in this textbook is available upon request from the authors (http://math.fullerton.edu/mathews/numerical.html). An instructor's solution manual for the exercise sets is available from the publisher. <p></p> Previously, we took the attitude that any software program that students mastered would work fine. However, many students entering this course have yet to master a programming language (computer science students excepted). MATLAB has become the tool of nearly all engineers and applied mathematicians, and its newest versions have improved the programming aspects. So we think that students will have an easier and more productive time in this MATLAB version of our text. <p></p></p><h2>The Journals of Ayn Rand</h2><p>The private journals of one of the most influential writers of the twentieth century, presented here in chronological order, reveal the progression of Rand&#39;s literary and philosophical ideals. 15,000 first printing.</p><p>Born February 2, 1905, <b>Ayn Rand</b> published her first novel, <i>We the Living</i>, in 1936. <i>Anthem</i> followed in 1938. It was with the publication of <i>The Fountainhead</i> (1943) and <i>Atlas Shrugged</i> (1957) that she achieved her spectacular success. Rand&#x2019;s unique philosophy, Objectivism, has gained a worldwide audience. The fundamentals of her philosophy are put forth in three nonfiction books, <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>, <i>The Virtues of Selfishness</i>, and <i>Capitalism: The Unknown Ideal</i>. They are all available in Signet editions, as is the magnificent statement of her artistic credo, <i>The Romantic Manifesto</i>.Both those inspired and those irritated by Rand's radical individualism will find support for their response in her journals. Sympathetic readers will enjoy sketches of unfinished projects, philosophical fragments, essays and testimony about communists in Hollywood, and extensive notes for her two major novels. Harriman's (Philosophy/Claremont Graduate School) sycophantic but helpful comments guide the reader through the unpublished material of an unwavering proponent of individualism and capitalism who is not afraid to condemn altruism or dismiss democratic authority with scorn. Indeed, the ease with which she labels most people ``parasites'' suggests that Rand was born too soon: Her self-confident dismissals of all who disagree would have made her a phenom on Crossfire or talk radio. Others will be struck by what is absent here: For Rand there are no open questions. She explicitly started ``with a set of ideas'' and then studied ``to support them.'' An instinctual antipathy to collectivism born of a childhood spent under communist rule established the substance of the writer's worldview, and her subsequent intellectual activity involved communicating convictions rather than exploring them. Fiction provided an outlet for this ideological single-mindedness, allowing her version of reality to be presented through fantasy worlds shorn of anything inconsistent with her beliefs. To demonstrate how individualism and collectivism work ``in real life'' and acceptance of a flawed concept such as charity results when we depart ``from facts,'' Rand wrote novels representing, she said, ``the kind of world I want.'' Even when recognizing that her idealization of the defendant in an actual criminal trial was probably inaccurate, she claimed that it ``does not make any difference,'' for even if he was not as she perceived him, ``he could be, and that's enough.'' This volume reveals not only how strong conclusions can flow from trumping fact with fiction, but also why Rand seemed to be living on another planet. -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Beginning with a study of structural antecedents found in late Roman architecture, the author examines Early Christian borrowings and transformations and selected representative types of Byzantine buildings. The following chapters cover the development of the monastic complex, traditional forms of Northern timber construction, and the contributions of the Carolingian and Ottonian empires. Spanish structures from the seventh century through the tenth century set the stage for the development of the Romanesque style, examined in its various regional manifestations. After identifying the structural sources of Gothic architecture, the author presents the evolving regional Gothic styles, Late Gothic elaborations and innovations, and representative types of secular architecture. The text concludes with an informative chapter on medieval building practices and the tradition of the Master Mason.<br><em>Medieval Architecture in Western Europe: From A.D. 300 to 1500</em> is thoroughly illustrated with plans, sections, diagrams, and photographs, and also includes an IBM-compatible CD-ROM, featuring over 800 supplementary views and details of the buildings discussed, all in color. Filling the gap between general surveys of architectural history and specialized works on specific periods and regions, this book is ideal for introductory courses in Medieval Architecture, but will also satisfy any reader with an interest in the Middle Ages.<br></p><p><br>Robert G. Calkins is a History of Art Professor at Cornell University. He has considerable experience with medieval architecture, having written two other books on this subject, <em>Monuments of Medieval Art</em> and <em>Illuminated Books of the Middle Ages</em>.<br>"This survey of 1200 years of Western medieval architecture will become a standard introductory text. Calkin's concise descriptions of individual monuments will expand students' understanding and appreciation of the subject. The book offers a remarkable overview of the diversity of building in<br>the period. The photographs and ground plans provide superb visual documentation."--Deborah Kahn, Boston University<br><br>"Fills a gap that has existed for quite some time. The monuments are judiciously selected, and the material is up to date for a survey.

Rather than limiting the text to coverage of the U.S. Supreme Court, G. Alan Tarr examines the judiciary as the third branch of government, and weaves four major premises throughout the text: 1) Courts in the United States have always played an important role in governing and that their role has increased in recent decades; 2) Judicial policymaking is a distinctive activity; 3) Courts make policy in a variety of ways; and 4) Courts may be the objects of public policy, as well as creators.</p><p>G. Alan Tarr received his doctorate from the University of Chicago. He is a distinguished professor of political science and director of the Center for State Constitutional Studies at Rutgers University, Camden. Professor Tarr has served as a constitutional consultant in Russia, South Africa, Cyprus, and Burma. A three-time NEH Fellow, he is currently completing a study of judicial independence and accountability in the American states."It is comprehensive and introduces students to all of the fundamentals in a very readable way with excellent examples and illustrations. It is regularly updated, which is also very important."<br><br>"JPJP is a thorough treatment of the American legal system, based on the reality that judges are political actors who make policy. It covers all of the usual topics in a good deal of detail and provides real-world examples to highlight its points. It also contains discussions of judicial process in other countries, which will assist students in understanding where the U.S. sits among the legal systems of the world."<br><br>"It is a typical judicial process text written by an esteemed political scientist. The book covers the basics, and it provides students with engaging account of key issues facing courts, judges, and the law."</p><h2>Musical Composition</h2><p>Musical composition is a key discipline in music programs in conservatories, colleges, and universities. Many teachers consider it as important in the development of young musicians as listening and performance. It can be argued that through compositions musicians achieve the deepest insight into the composer and his music. <em>Musical Composition</em> takes the student through the elements--melody, harmony, counterpoint, and rhythm--before covering a variety of special subjects such as writing vocal and choral music, accompaniments, and film and TV music. Chapters are devoted to recent techniques including free diatonicism, serialism, and indeterminacy. Over 200 examples illustrate points in the text and there are exercises for each chapter.<br></p><p><br>"Reginald Smith Brindle...is a composer who is also a brilliant communicator and teacher, and he provides just such a variety of suggestions and assignments....In this comprehensive but skillfully concise book, he addresses the needs of those school and university students 'not born with an intuitive grasp of "how to do it," who have a lot to learn [and] who need to be helped over the first hurdles....The range of examples is impressive: from Dowland to Dallapiccola, Purcell to Posseur--a wisely broad spectrum with a significant leaning towards the 20th century. Above all, Smith Brindle has the happy knack of being able to show, in a few words, precisely why a certain technique serves a composer's artistic purpose."--John Paynter, I usical Times<p></p><br></p><h2>History of the Balkans, Vol. 1: Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries (Joint Committee on Eastern Europe Publication Series)</h2><p>Volume I discusses the history of the major Balkan nationalities. It describes the differing conditions experienced under Ottoman and Habsburg rule, but the main emphasis is on the national movements, their successes and failures to 1900, and the place of events in the Balkans in the international relations of the day.</p><p>The major emphasis of Volume 1 is on the movements for national sovereignty, the revolutionary activity associated with them, and the place of these events in the international relations of the day for the major nationalities of the Balkan region. Volume 2 deals primarily with events in the 20th century. A large portion of this volume is devoted to wartime experiences, the establishment of postwar regimes, and their internal development to 1980.This volume discusses the history of the major Balkan nationalities in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.</p><h2>Frankenstein</h2><p><p>Tor Classics are affordably-priced editions designed to attract the young reader.

Then the ghastly thing opens its hideous, soulless eyes and Frankenstein flees into the night, shrieking with horror--</p><p>Leaving a being who wants love and finds hate, wants friends and finds enemies, wants another and finds no one. Frankenstein is its father, mother, maker and living god, and Frankenstein has abandonded his own monster to a living hell of unutterable isolation. But now, unstoppable, the creature means to get revenge for having been born--</p><p>Not by killing its creator...but by destroying everything holds dear, and everyone Frankenstein loves...</p></p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books." Includes an illuminating afterword by Joyce Carol Oates.A collection of literature anthologies and reference books for Key Stage 3 onwards.</p><h2>Motivating People to Be Physically Active (Physical Activity Intervention)</h2><p><p><i>Motivating People to Be Physically Active, Second Edition,</i> translates research, theories, and concepts of behavioral science into a useful handbook for health professionals involved in the planning, development, implementation, or evaluation of physical activity promotion programs.

Ten never came back. This is the story of that crew - where they came from, how they trained, what it was like to fly a B-24 through enemy flak, and who was waiting for them to come home. Historian Thomas Childers, nephew of the Black Cat&#39;s radio operator, has reconstructed the lives and tragic deaths of these men through their letters home and through in-depth interviews, both with their families and with German villagers who lived near the crash site. In so doing he unearths confusion about the exact number of crash survivors and ugly rumors of their fate at the hands of the German villagers. His search to determine what really happened leads him to the crash site outside of Regensburg to lay the mystery to rest.Thomas Childers is a professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania.</p><h2>Bringing Out the Best in Everyone You Coach: Use the Enneagram System for Exceptional Results</h2><p><p>&#x201c;Clearly written, well organized, and practical, we predict this will quickly become the &#x2018;standard&#x2019; Enneagram coaching book for years to come.&#x201d;<br> <b>Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson, bestselling authors of <i>Personality Types</i> and <i>The Wisdom of the Enneagram</i></b></p> <p><b>Create powerful growth programs tailor-made for each employee!</b></p> <p>Whether you&#x2019;re a coach, manager, or mentor, the Enneagram System is a highly effective tool for creating self-aware employees that are easy to manage.</p> <p>Enneagram expert Ginger Lapid-Bogda explains how to use the system&#x2019;s nine number types to pinpoint each person&#x2019;s style, tap into his or her strengths, and design customized growth programs for each one.</p> <p>Cross-cultural and proven to be highly accurate, the Enneagram is the ideal tool for creating employees that:</p><ul> <li>Communicate clearly </li><li>Work more productively </li><li>Collaborate effectively </li><li>Make decisions with confidence </li><li>Take personal responsibility </li><li>Become better leaders</li></ul> <p>Lapid-Bogda reveals which specific coaching techniques are the most effective based on individual style and provides a clear process for the three types of coaching: short-term, crisis, and long-term.</p> <p>Enneagram development time is shorter than in other programs, and results are clearer and longer-lasting.

In great detail, the issues that Joe Hill raised and grappled with in his life: capitalism, white supremacy, gender, religion, wilderness, law, prison, and industrial unionism are shown in both the context of Hill&#x2019;s life and for their enduring relevance in the century since his death. Collected too is Joe Hill&#x2019;s art, plus scores of other images featuring Hill-inspired art by IWW illustrators. As Rosemont suggests in this remarkable book, Joe Hill never really died as he lives in the minds of rebels as long as his songs are sung, his ideas are circulated, and his political descendants keep fighting for a better day.</p><p><b>Franklin Rosemont</b> was a poet, an artist, and an activist who was involved in the history of surrealism and the radical labor movement in the United States.

Although there are hundreds of species of butterflies in <br>North America, they somehow escape public notice most of the time. Out in <br>plain sight, they lead secret lives.<br> I still recall how surprised I was when I began to notice them <br>myself. At the age of fourteen, having learned a lot of my local birds, I <br>decided to see if there were any butterflies in the neighborhood. Amazingly, <br>as soon as I began looking for them, they appeared: Little Wood-Satyrs <br>flopping through the woods, tiny Reakirt"s Blues on weed flowers in vacant <br>lots, and dozens more. Although I had been outside looking for birds, up to <br>that time I had utterly missed these other winged creatures. <br> Butterflies are not birds, of course. They are very different in their <br>habits, yearly cycles, and population dynamics. And they"re a lot smaller. <br>The biggest ones, like Monarchs and Giant Swallowtails, may grab our <br>attention, but most of the diversity is among the smaller butterflies. We <br>have far more species of little hairstreaks, blues, skippers, and the like than <br>we do of the big guys. Small can be beautiful: even the tiniest butterflies have <br>intricate patterns that are well worth appreciating. But until recently, it has <br>been extremely difficult to identify many of these butterflies in the field. <br>Even separating some larger species has been problematic, because their <br>identification often depends on small details. Until the recent development <br>of good close-focusing binoculars and cameras, many butterflies could be <br>recognized only by expert lepidopterists with vast experience. <br> I have been lucky enough to have one such lepidopterist as a <br>good friend for years, and luckier still that he is the kind of expert who is <br>always ready to share his knowledge. Jim Brock has studied butterflies <br>from Alaska to Brazil, and in the field he dazzles everyone with his ability to <br>find and identify even the rare and little-known species; but he will also <br>patiently point out the most common butterflies to anyone who wants to <br>know them. Jim agreed to coauthor this book as a way of helping new-<br>comers to the field. In doing so, he graciously accepted the challenge of our <br>Focus Guide format: boiling his vast knowledge down to just the essentials <br>that would be most useful in a pocket-sized book. If any serious <br>lepidopterists are displeased by the treatments here, they should blame me, <br>not Jim Brock. <br> But of course serious lepidopterists (who already have their <br>technical reference works) are not the primary audience for this book. The <br>Focus Guides are shortcuts, intended to be the best and fastest way to get <br>started in a subject, to send you outside quickly, putting names on what <br>you find. Slip this book into your pocket the next time you go exploring, and <br>start discovering the secret world of butterflies for yourself. <br><br>IDENTIFYING BUTTERFLIES<br>In naming a butterfly, the first step is to make sure that it really is one. The <br>order Lepidoptera includes the moths as well as the butterflies, and some <br>moths are active by day and are quite colorful. Usually they sit or behave in <br>an obviously different way from butterflies. If in doubt, look at the antennae. <br>On butterflies, the tip of each antenna has a thickened area, or "club." North <br>American moths lack this feature; their antennae are either threadlike to the <br>tip, feathery, or fringed along the edges.<br> Butterflies have four wings: two on each side, the forewing and the <br>hindwing. The upperside and underside of each wing usually has a different <br>pattern. To describe a color pattern on a butterfly, therefore, we have to say <br>where it is &#x2014; for example, on the upperside of the forewing. Lepidopterists <br>can describe butterfly patterns in great detail using a system of numbering <br>the wing veins and the spaces between them. It"s hard to apply that system <br>to an active butterfly in the wild, so we don"t use it in this guide, except to <br>point out the cell, an area outlined by veins near the base of each wing. <br>However, a few terms are necessary for communicating about the intricate <br>patterns of some species; see the diagrams below for the simplified <br>terminology used in this guide. <br><br>What to look for: Wing patterns are obviously important in identifying <br>butterflies, but they are not the only clues. Here are some other points to <br>consider. <br><br>Size: Some swallowtails are six inches or more from one wingtip to the <br>other, while some blues are much less than an inch across. Since these <br>wingspan measurements are hard for most people to visualize, we have <br>treated sizes in this guide by showing one individual on each color plate at <br>actual life size in gray outline. The illustrations are in correct scale relative <br>to the others on that page, but not necessarily to those on other pages; be <br>sure to check the "actual size" figure each time you turn the page, to get an <br>idea whether the butterflies shown are actually big, medium-sized, or small. <br> Little butterflies do not grow up to be big ones: once they <br>complete the transformation to winged adult, their size does not change. <br>However, there are variations within a species. Early spring individuals are <br>often smaller than those of summer; females are often larger than males. <br>And occasionally we see a "runt" individual that is oddly small. But with <br>experience, you will find that size is usually a good quick clue to <br>identification. <br><br>Shape: At a glance, most butterflies may seem to be roughly the same <br>shape. With closer study, you will begin to see differences in wing shapes <br>that help to create the distinctive look of each species. Some have <br>extended "tails" on the hindwings, or jagged or scalloped outer wing <br>margins. Other differences are much more subtle, such as the wingtips being <br>slightly more rounded or pointed. But with practice you will find that a <br>butterfly"s shape is an important identifying mark. <br><br>Posture: The way a butterfly sits is always worth noticing. Sulphurs almost <br>always perch with their wings folded tightly above their backs; metalmarks <br>usually have their wings spread out flat; cloudywings usually hold their <br>wings half open in a shallow V; and grass skippers often hold their hindwings <br>spread farther than their forewings. Any butterfly may sit in an odd position <br>at times, but the typical posture can be a good clue to identification. We <br>have tried to illustrate and describe this for all species.<br><br>Flight style: Experts often can recognize a butterfly as it flits past &#x2014; not <br>because they can actually see detailed field marks on its fast-moving <br>wings, but because the way it flies is a field mark in itself. Some species fly <br>erratically, others more directly; some flutter along with regular steady <br>flaps, while others flap a few times quickly and then glide. These flight styles <br>are hard to describe in words, but with practice you will learn to recognize <br>many of them. <br><br>Fine details: Some field marks involve very small details, such as the colors <br>of the eyes, the color or pattern on the antennae, or the color of the "face" <br>(the palps, on the front of the head). These things really can be seen in the <br>field, but for wary species you may need to use binoculars. Good <br>binoculars are now available that can focus as close as just a few feet away, <br>allowing incredible views of butterflies and other small creatures.<br><br>Variation in butterflies: As with humans and other living things, no two <br>individual butterflies look exactly alike. Most of the variation within a <br>species is so minor that you won"t notice it in the field, but sometimes it"s <br>enough to cause confusion. Occasionally you"ll see an individual that looks <br>totally unlike the normal color pattern for its species; these aberrant <br>butterflies may be identifiable only by shape or other clues. <br> Many species vary from place to place, and if these variations are <br>well marked, a local or regional population may be designated as a <br>subspecies; see p. 14 for more information. There are also seasonal <br>variations. For example, Zebra Swallowtails flying in spring are smaller and <br>paler than those flying in summer, even though they all belong to the same <br>species; Goatweed Leafwings flying in fall have more sharply pointed <br>forewings than those flying in early summer. Males and females often differ <br>in pattern or even in shape &#x2014; sometimes subtly, sometimes so strikingly <br>that they appear to be unrelated. And finally, every individual butterfly <br>gradually changes in appearance as its condition becomes more worn and <br>faded. The two Painted Ladies shown here, for example, were sitting on <br>flowers in the same meadow. The ragged one on the right can still be <br>identified, because Painted Ladies have lots of field marks, but some <br>butterflies in this condition would be unrecognizeable. <br><br>Habitat and season: Many butterflies are restricted to particular habitats, <br>and this is a key not only to finding them but to identifying them. We give <br>habitat descriptions for most species in this guide, and these should always <br>be considered. Seasons are important as well. Even in warm climates, only a <br>few species are on the wing year-round; in most species, adults are present <br>only in certain seasons. We usually describe these flight seasons in <br>general terms, such as "early summer," and these designations relate to <br>local conditions, not arbitrary calendar dates. The Sara Orangetip, for <br>example, is an early spring butterfly. It may appear by late January in <br>Arizona and not until the end of May in the Yukon Territory, but those dates <br>qualify as "early spring" in both locations. <br><br>About the illustrations: Naturalists have debated for years whether field <br>guides should be illustrated with paintings or photographs. This book uses <br>a third method, introduced in 2000 with the first Kaufman Focus Guide, Birds <br>of North America: we begin with photos and edit them digitally to make them <br>all directly comparable, as paintings would be. <br> Some butterflies, such as sulphurs, never bask with their wings <br>open; but it is still useful to know the colors of their uppersides, because <br>even at a glimpse in flight, a pale yellow one will look different from an <br>orange one with black borders. For most species like this, we provide <br>illustrations at reduced size showing their uppersides as an aid to <br>identification. Understanding the range maps: One of the most important <br>clues to identification involves knowing where you are. Most butterflies have <br>very specific ranges and are unlikely to be seen anywhere else. This is a <br>good thing, because some groups include similar species that are much <br>easier to tell apart by range than by field marks. For example, Eastern and <br>Western Tailed-Blues look very much alike, but in most places you will find <br>only one or the other, not both. In identifying any butterfly, always check the <br>range maps to see which ones are likely in your region. <br> Most of the range maps in this guide have the distributions of the <br>butterflies indicated in green. This color means that the species is flying in <br>summer (the peak butterfly season in most areas) or in more than one <br>season (for example, spring and summer, or even most of the year). We <br>use a darker shade of green for areas where the species is most common, <br>and a paler shade for areas where it is less likely to be seen. These <br>designations are quite arbitrary, but we hope they will be helpful in giving a <br>general idea of which species are most expected. <br> A few species fly mainly in spring or mainly in fall; these are <br>mapped in blue for spring, orange for fall, again with a darker shade for the <br>areas where they are more common.<br> Some butterflies, especially from southern regions, sometimes <br>stray far from their normal haunts. If there is a regular pattern of such <br>straying, we indicate it on the map with a dashed line beyond the typical <br>range.<br><br>FINDING BUTTERFLIES<br>Some butterflies are adaptable and may show up almost anywhere, but <br>most prefer a particular habitat. You will not see Salt Marsh Skippers in a <br>forest or Desert Elfins in a marsh. To see a wide variety of butterflies, <br>therefore, it"s necessary to visit many habitats. You should go at various <br>seasons, because many species have rather short flight periods: Falcate <br>Orangetips fly only in spring, Apache Skippers only in fall. This adds to the <br>enjoyment of butterfly watching, because you can hope to see different <br>species on repeat visits to the same place during the year. <br><br>Flowers: Not all butterflies fit the classic image of visiting flowers to sip <br>nectar &#x2014; some species are rarely or never seen at flowers. Still, to get <br>started, the easiest way to find butterflies is to find a good patch of blooms <br>in a garden or meadow, or by a roadside. Some flowers seem to be more <br>attractive than others, and some butterflies prefer certain types of flowers, <br>so it pays to look in a variety of places. <br><br>Mud: Males of some butterflies, including blues, swallowtails, and sulphurs, <br>are strongly attracted to damp soil. They are apparently taking in salts and <br>other chemicals from the mud. Sometimes these "puddle parties" involve <br>several species and hundreds of individuals, while at other times only a few <br>individuals will be present, but you should always check puddles and pond <br>edges for the presence of butterflies. <br><br>Other baits: Many butterflies are attracted to odd things such as flowing <br>sap, rotting fruit, or animal dung. (This is especially true of some species that <br>tend to ignore flowers, such as the Goatweed Leafwing and the Question <br>Mark.) <br><br>Aside from these feeding behaviors, adult butterflies put most of their <br>energy into activities related to reproduction. Males spend a lot of time <br>looking for females; females spend much time looking for the right places to <br>lay their eggs. Knowing their behaviors can help you find them.<br><br>Hilltopping: Male butterflies of some species look for mates by flying to the <br>top of a hill and patrolling or waiting there for the females to show up. If we <br>check the tops of low hills, especially from late morning to afternoon, we <br>may see butterflies that are hard to find in the surrounding country. <br><br>Patrolling: Males of other species fly back and forth along linear pathways, <br>such as trails or gullies, looking for females. They may come back time <br>after time to the same perches, allowing for repeated views.<br><br>Foodplants: Many butterflies are closely tied to the plants on which their <br>larvae feed. Hessel"s Hairstreaks are seldom seen away from Atlantic white <br>cedars; Square-spotted Blues are usually seen sitting on buckwheats. A <br>skilled lepidopterist is often able to find particular butterflies by learning to <br>recognize their larval foodplants. <br><br>THE BUTTERFLY"S LIFE CYCLE<br>The amazing process of metamorphosis &#x2014; the butterfly"s transition from <br>egg to caterpillar to pupa to winged adult &#x2014; is well known and fairly well <br>understood, but it is still rightly regarded as a miracle.<br> The process begins with the egg laid by the adult female on or <br>near the plants that will serve as food for the caterpillars. Most butterfly <br>caterpillars cannot survive on the wrong plants, so the adult"s choice of</p><h2>The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference</h2><p>Complete and comprehensive coverage is given of the full ANSI/ISO C++ standard.</p><p>Programming with the C++ Standard Library can certainly be difficult, but Nicolai Josuttis's <i>The C++ Standard Library</i> provides one of the best available guides to using the built-in features of C++ effectively.<p> The C++ Standard Library provides plenty of default functionality in the form of the Standard Template Library (STL) for containers (like vectors and linked lists), as well as generic algorithms (which allow you to sort, search, and manipulate elements inside containers). The best thing about <i>The C++ Standard Library</i> is that it gives the reader a concise guide to working with these basic containers (from lists to sets and maps, with everything in between). Each container type is explained along with short code excerpts. Moreover, in a reference section, the author explores the connections between each container type, showing how they share similar methods. (Learn just a few methods and you can pretty much work with them all.) </p><p> In addition to STL, this book excels at providing a readable introduction to the generic algorithms (which can be used to sort, search, and otherwise manipulate STL containers). Other books either fold this material in with the explanation of containers or make it seem like an esoteric topic. The fact is, generic algorithms work with all the STL types, and by separating these algorithms out like this the reader can learn the rich array of algorithms available in today's standard C++. While this book concentrates on STL and algorithms, readers will still find great coverage on Standard Library string classes and streams (including a fine section on internationalization and locales).</p><p> For the beginning or intermediate C++ programmer, <i>The C++ Standard Library</i> can be a real timesaver. It arranges and explains the complexities of the C++ Standard Library and STL in a manageable format that's great as a reference and as an approach to programming. <i>--Richard Dragan</i></p><p> <b>Topics covered</b>: history of C++ and the Standard Library, template basics, Big-O Notation, the std namespace, standard exceptions, allocators, standard library utilities, pairs and auto_ptr, numeric limits, the Standard Template Library (STL) basics, containers, iterators, algorithms, vectors, lists, deques, strings, sets, multisets, bitsets, maps, multimaps, stacks, queues, iterator adapters, function objects, element requirements, value and reference semantics, complex numbers, valarrays, stream classes, stream manipulators and formatting, file I/O, internationalization, and locales.</p><p> In the beginning, I only planned to write a small German book (400 pages or so) about the C++ Standard Library. That was in 1993. Now, in 1999 you see the result--an English book with more than 800 pages of facts, figures, and examples. My goal is to describe the C++ Standard Library so that all (or almost all) your programming questions are answered before you think of the question. Note, however, that this is not a complete description of all aspects of the C++ Standard Library. Instead, I present the most important topics necessary for learning and programming in C++by using its standard library.</p><p></p><p> Each topic is described based on the general concepts;this discussion then leads to the specific details needed to support everyday programming tasks.

This led to the goal of standardization. Only by having a standard, could programs be written that would run on different platforms--from PCs to mainframes. Furthermore, a standard C++ library would enable programmers to use general components and a higher level of abstraction without losing portability, rather than having to develop all code from scratch.</p><p></p><p> The standardization process was started in 1989 by an international ANSI/ISO committee. It developed the standard based on Bjarne Stroustrup's books (The C++ Programming Language) and (The Annotated C++ Reference Manual). After the standard was completed in 1997,several formal motions by different countries made it an international ISO and ANSI standard in 1998. The standardization process included the development of a C++ Standard Library. The library extends the core language to provide some general components. By using C++'s ability to program new abstract and generic types, the library provides a set of common classes and interfaces. This gives programmers a higher level of abstraction. The library provides the ability to use string types, different data structures (such as dynamic arrays, linked lists, and binary trees), different algorithms (such as different sorting algorithms), numeric classes, input/output (I/O) classes, and classes for internationalization support. </p><p> All of these are supported by a fairly simple programming interface. These components are very important for many programs. These days, data processing often means inputting, computing, processing, and outputting large amounts of data, which are often strings.</p><p></p><p> The library is not self-explanatory. To use these components and to benefit from their power,you need a good introduction that explains the concepts and the important details instead of simply listing the classes and their functions. This book is written exactly for that purpose. First, it introduces the library and all of its components from a conceptional point of view. Next, it describes the details needed for practical programming. Examples are included to demonstrate the exact usage of the components. Thus, this book is a detailed introduction to the C++ library for both the beginner and the practical programmer. Armed with the data provided herein, you should be able to take full advantage of the C++ Standard Library.</p><p>Caveat </p><p> I don't promise that everything described is easy and self-explanatory. The library provides a lot of flexibility,but flexibility for nontrivial purposes has a price. Beware that the library has traps and pitfalls,which I point out when we encounter them and suggest ways of avoiding them.</p><p>What You Should Know Before Reading this Book </p><p> To get the most from this book you should already know C++. (The book describes the standard components of C++, but not the language itself.) You should be familiar with the concepts of classes, inheritance,templates, and exception handling. However, you don't have to know all of the minor details about the language. The important details are described in the book (the minor details about the language are more important for people who want to implement the library rather than use it). Note that the language has changed during the standardization process,so your knowledge might not be up to date.</p><p></p><p> The section on newlang features provides a brief overview and introduction of the latest language features that are important for using the library. You should read this section if you are not sure whether you know all the new features of C++ (such as the keyword {\tt typename} and the concept of namespaces).</p><p>Style and Structure of the Book </p><p> The C++ Standard Library provides different components that are somewhat but not totally independent of each other,so there is no easy way to describe each part without mentioning others. I considered several different approaches for presenting the contents of this book. One was on the order of the C++ standard. However, this is not the best way to explain the components of the C++ Standard Library from scratch. Another was to start with an overview of all components followed by chapters that provided more details. Alternatively, I could have sorted the components, trying to find an order that had a minimum of cross-references to other sections. My solution was to use a mixture of all three approaches. </p><p> I start with a brief introduction of the general concepts and the utilities that are used by the library. Then, I describe all the components, each in one or more chapters. The first component is the standard template library (STL). There is no doubt that the STL is the most powerful, most complex, and most exciting part of the library. Its design influences other components heavily. Then I describe the more self-explanatory components, such as special containers, strings,and numeric classes. The next component discussed is one you probably know and use already: the iostreamlib{}. It is followed by a discussion of internationalization, which had some influence on the iostreamlib{}.</p><p></p><p> Each component description begins with the component's purpose, design, and some examples. Next, a detailed description follows that begins with different ways to use the component, as well as any traps and pitfalls associated with it. The description usually ends with a reference section, in which you can find the exact signature and definition of a component's classes and its functions.</p><p>How to Read this Book </p><p> This book is a mix of introductory user's guide and structured reference manual regarding the C++ Standard Library. The individual components of the C++ Standard Library are independent of each other, to some extent, so after reading Chapters 2 through 4 you could read the chapters that discuss the individual components in any order. Bear in mind,that Chapters 5 through 9 all describe the same component. To understand the other STL chapters, you should start with the introduction to the STL in chapter 5.</p><p></p><p> If you are a C++ programmer who wants to know, in general, the concepts and all parts of the library, you could simply read the book from the beginning to the end. However, you should skip the reference sections (which usually are named something like "...{} in detail}"). To program with certain components of the C++ Standard Library, the best way to find something is to use the index. I have tried to make the index very comprehensive to save you time when you are looking for something.</p><p></p><p> I can't explain all aspects at the same time, so you will find many cross references. It is always a problem to decide whether to follow them. If the cross reference refers to a section that will follow soon, take it as hint that I return to an aspect later. You should follow the cross reference only if you are searching for certain aspects or details and the cross reference seems to lead to details concerning your problem or its solution.</p><p></p><p> In my experience, the best way to learn something new is to look at examples. Therefore, you'll find a lot of examples throughout the book. They may be a few lines of code or complete programs. In the latter case, you'll find the name of the file containing the program's first comment line. You can find the files on the Internet at my Web site josuttis/libbook/.</p><p>State of the Art </p><p> While I was writing this book,the C++ standard was completed. Please bear in mind that some compilers might not yet confirm to it. This will most likely change in the near future. As a consequence, you might discover that not all things covered in this book work as described on your system,and you may have to change example programs to fit your specific environment. I can compile almost all example programs with version 2.Example Code and Additional Information </p><p> You can access all example programs and acquire more informations about this book and the C++ Standard Library from my Web site at josuttis/libbook/.

This groundbreaking book refutes the common belief that the ancient Greeks and Romans harbored "ethnic and cultural," but not racial, prejudice. It does so by comprehensively tracing the intellectual origins of racism back to classical antiquity. Benjamin Isaac's systematic analysis of ancient social prejudices and stereotypes reveals that some of those represent prototypes of racism--or proto-racism--which in turn inspired the early modern authors who developed the more familiar racist ideas. He considers the literature from classical Greece to late antiquity in a quest for the various forms of the discriminatory stereotypes and social hatred that have played such an important role in recent history and continue to do so in modern society.</p><br><p> Magisterial in scope and scholarship, and engagingly written, <i>The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity</i> further suggests that an understanding of ancient attitudes toward other peoples sheds light not only on Greco-Roman imperialism and the ideology of enslavement (and the concomitant integration or non-integration) of foreigners in those societies, but also on the disintegration of the Roman Empire and on more recent imperialism as well. The first part considers general themes in the history of discrimination; the second provides a detailed analysis of proto-racism and prejudices toward particular groups of foreigners in the Greco-Roman world. The last chapter concerns Jews in the ancient world, thus placing anti-Semitism in a broader context.</p></p><p>"A revolutionary work of immense relevance to the tensions of our contemporary globalized society. Enormous in scope, erudition, and importance, it is lucidly written and can easily be appreciated by any historically minded reader."--Glen W. Bowersock, Institute for Advanced Study <p>"Benjamin Isaac's treatment of this complex problem is the first comprehensive, intelligible, and truly magisterial one of which I am aware. The book will be an invaluable source of information, discussion, and interpretation for any person (scholar or layman) interested in any aspect of the problem of ethnic identity, whether in antiquity or in modern times."--Martin Ostwald, Swarthmore College and University of Pennsylvania </p><p>"<i>The Invention of Racism in Classical Antiquity</i>" is by far the most sweeping and all-encompassing study of stereotypes and hostile portrayals by Greeks and Romans of other peoples that has yet been written. Isaac details the classical world's biased conceptualizations of Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Syrians, Egyptians, Persians, Gauls, Germans, and Jews. As Isaac shows, the diverse images constructed at that time of genetic inferiority, of environmental and geographic influence, of descent and lineage, and propagation of fear of the alien have had an enduring impact on thinkers and public figures in Europe and the United States even up to the present time."--Erich S.

On the flip side, they pollinate crops, provide food for birds and other wildlife, produce honey and other useful things, and serve as bellwether indicators of our environment's health. That's to say nothing of aesthetic worth. Iridescent dragonflies weaving patterns of light as they patrol a lakeshore, a ghostly luna moth drifting through the dusk-encounters like these enrich our lives enormously.</p><p>That's what <i>Hey, Bug Doctor!</i> is all about: appreciating that the difference between a pesky and a helpful bug often comes down to how, when, and where you find it. Few of us realize that better than entomologist Jim Howell, who is known to readers of the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i> through his helpful, humorous columns on getting along with bugs. Gathered here are Howell's profiles of over sixty crawling and flying (and yes, biting and stinging) bugs commonly found in homes, gardens, and yards in Georgia and around the Southeast.</p><p>Each illustrated profile describes the bug's appearance, diet, behavior, and impact on the natural and built environments. Like Howell's widely read newspaper columns, the profiles offer unusual facts, popular myths, and stories of real-life encounters. A single square yard of your lawn or garden can contain hundreds, even thousands, of bugs. Here is proven, practical guidance on those beautiful, ugly, harmless, toxic, and ultimately amazing creatures with which you share your home and yard.</p><p>LAWN AND GARDEN INSECTSDoodlebugs: Part of Rural AmericanaFire Ants: A Double Whammy of PainLuna Moths: Charming Guests in Your GardenFireflies: Fairy Lanterns in the BackyardRELATIVESSpider Mites: Nasty in Hot, Dry WeatherGolden Garden Spiders: Welcome This Web Weaver to Feast in Your GardenChiggers: Ooooohhh, Those Itchy RedbugsTicks: Don't Get "Ticked" with Warm Spring WeatherHOUSEHOLD INSECTSBedbugs and Batbugs: Tiny Bedroom VampiresFruit Flies: Drunk on Their Own SuccessCockroaches: Will They Outlast Us All?Termites: Your Home Is Their Sunday BuffetRELATIVESDaddy-Longlegs: Alien Invaders?Dust Mites: Gesundheit!Common House Spiders: Messy But HarmlessBlack Widows and Brown Recluses: Are They Really Husband Killers and Loners?</p></p><p>JIM HOWELL writes a popular weekly column in the Home and Garden section of the <i>Atlanta Journal-Constitution</i>.

Now Havil is back with <i>Impossible?</i>, another marvelous medley of the utterly confusing, profound, and unbelievable&#x2015;and all of it mathematically irrefutable.</p><p>Whenever Forty-second Street in New York is temporarily closed, traffic doesn't gridlock but flows more smoothly&#x2015;why is that? Or consider that cities that build new roads can experience dramatic increases in traffic congestion&#x2015;how is this possible? What does the game show <i>Let's Make A Deal</i> reveal about the unexpected hazards of decision-making? What can the game of cricket teach us about the surprising behavior of the law of averages? These are some of the counterintuitive mathematical occurrences that readers encounter in <i>Impossible?</i></p><p>Havil ventures further than ever into territory where intuition can lead one astray. He gathers entertaining problems from probability and statistics along with an eclectic variety of conundrums and puzzlers from other areas of mathematics, including classics of abstract math like the Banach-Tarski paradox. These problems range in difficulty from easy to highly challenging, yet they can be tackled by anyone with a background in calculus. And the fascinating history and personalities associated with many of the problems are included with their mathematical proofs. <i>Impossible?</i> will delight anyone who wants to have their reason thoroughly confounded in the most astonishing and unpredictable ways.</p></p><p><p>"Julian Havil's <i>Impossible?</i> is a superb discussion of problems easily understood by a high schooler, yet with solutions so counterintuitive as to seem impossible. Topics include the notorious Monty Hall three-door problem, the Gamow-Stern elevator paradoxes, the Kruskal count card trick, Cantor's 'paradise' of alephs, and the mind-blowing Banach-Tarski paradox, all analyzed in depth by a master who does not hold back equations that provide elegant proofs. There are surprises on almost every page."--<b>Martin Gardner</b></p><p>"This book is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable read. Havil offers an engaging collection of counterintuitive results and seemingly impossible problems. Some of the material is truly astonishing, and the author conveys his sense of surprise very effectively. Each problem ultimately yields to careful and well-presented analysis. The history of many of the results is discussed, and further references are provided."--<b>Nick Hobson, creator of the award-winning Web site <i>Nick's Mathematical Puzzles</i></b></p><p>"I thought it impossible for Julian Havil to exceed <i>Nonplussed!</i>, his previous collection of perplexing math puzzlers.

The major protagonists include Thomas Church, Roberto Burle Marx, Isamu Noguchi, Luis Barragan, Daniel Urban Kiley, Stanley White, Hideo Sasaki, Ian McHarg, Lawrence Halprin, and Garrett Eckbo. They were the pioneers of a new profession in America, the first to offer alternatives to the historic landscape and the park tradition, as well as to the suburban sprawl and other unplanned developments of twentieth-century cities and institutions. The work is described against the backdrop of the Great Depression, the Second World War, the postwar recovery, American corporate expansion, and the environmental revolution. The authors look at unbuilt schemes as well as actual gardens, ranging from tiny backyards and play spaces to urban plazas and corporate villas. Some of the projects discussed already occupy a canonical position in modern landscape architecture; others deserve a similar place but are less well known. The result is a record of landscape architecture's cultural contribution - as distinctly different in history, intent, and procedure from its sister fields of architecture and planning - during the years when it was acquiring professional status and struggling to define a modernist aesthetic out of the startling changes in postwar America.</p></p><p>Peter Walker, one of the most accomplished American landscape architects practicing today, is a Principal in Peter Walker William Johnson and Partners, San Francsico.

Erich Heller's lifelong study of modern European literature necessarily returns again and again to Friedrich Nietzsche.<br> <br> Nietzsche prided himself on having broken with all traditional ways of thinking and feeling, and once even claimed that he would someday be recognized for having ushered in a new millennium. While acknowledging Nietzsche's radicalism, Heller also insists on the continuity of the story in which he does indeed occupy a central place. By considering Nietzsche in relation to Goethe, Rilke, Wittgenstein, Yeats, and others, Heller shows the philosopher's ambivalence toward the tradition he inherited as well as his profound effect on the thought and sensibility of those who followed him. It is hardly an exaggeration to say, as Heller does in his first essay, that Nietzsche is to many modern writers and thinkers&#x2014;including Mann, Musil, Kafka, Freud, Heidegger, Jaspers, Gide, and Sartre&#x2014;what St. Thomas Aquinas was to Dante: the categorical interpreter of a world, which they contemplate imaginatively and theoretically without ever much upsetting its Nietzschean structure.<br> <br> Thus it is Nietzsche's thought, so pervasively present in the themes of modernity, that gives coherence and unity to Heller's essays. What emerges from them is that, despite his iconoclastic declarations and unorthodox philosophical practices, Nietzsche deals with the human spirit's persistent concerns. His questions remain urgent, and even the answers, in all their contradictoriness, possess the commanding force of his inquiry. An example is the incompatibility of the famous extremes, the teaching of the <i>�bermensch</i> and the Eternal Recurrence of All Things. These cancel each other out and yet grow from the same intellectual and spiritual roots, as is shown lucidly and cogently by one of Heller's most forceful essays, "Nietzsche's Terrors: Time and the Inarticulate." In fathoming the depth of this contradiction, Heller at the same time reveals the importance of Nietzsche for those who seek to understand the wellsprings of the epoch's disquiet, turmoil, <i>and</i> creativity.</p></p><p>In this book, one of the most distinguished scholars of German culture collects his essays on a figure who has long been one of his chief preoccupations.<b>Erich Heller</b>, Avalon Professor of the Humanities emeritus at Northwestern University, is the author of many books, including <i>The Disinherited Mind</i> and <i>In the Age of Prose</i>.</p><h2>In Pursuit of the Past: Decoding the Archaeological Record</h2><p>Discusses the efforts of archeologists to trace the evolution of human culture and describes the methods used to study archeological remains</p><p><b>Lewis R.

Yet even as Democrats swooned, a small cadre of Republican operatives, including Karl Rove, Ed Gillespie, and Chris Jankowski began plotting their comeback with a simple yet ingenious plan. These men had devised a way to take a tradition of dirty tricks&#x2015;known to political insiders as &#x201c;ratf**king&#x201d;&#x2015;to a whole new, unprecedented level. Flooding state races with a gold rush of dark money made possible by <em>Citizens United</em>, the Republicans reshaped state legislatures, where the power to redistrict is held. Reconstructing this never- told-before story, David Daley examines the far-reaching effects of this so-called REDMAP program, which has radically altered America&#x2019;s electoral map and created a firewall in the House, insulating the party and its wealthy donors from popular democracy. <em>Ratf**ked</em> pulls back the curtain on one of the greatest heists in American political history. 5 maps</p><p>David Daley is the author of Ratf**ked.

A distinguished evolutionary biologist, Roughgarden takes on the medical establishment, the Bible, social science&#x2015;and even Darwin himself. She leads the reader through a fascinating discussion of diversity in gender and sexuality among fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals, including primates. <i>Evolution's Rainbow </i>explains how this diversity develops from the action of genes and hormones and how people come to differ from each other in all aspects of body and behavior. Roughgarden reconstructs primary science in light of feminist, gay, and transgender criticism and redefines our understanding of sex, gender, and sexuality. Witty, playful, and daring, this book will revolutionize our understanding of sexuality. <br><br>Roughgarden argues that principal elements of Darwinian sexual selection theory are false and suggests a new theory that emphasizes social inclusion and control of access to resources and mating opportunity. She disputes a range of scientific and medical concepts, including Wilson's genetic determinism of behavior, evolutionary psychology, the existence of a gay gene, the role of parenting in determining gender identity, and Dawkins's "selfish gene" as the driver of natural selection. She dares social science to respect the agency and rationality of diverse people; shows that many cultures across the world and throughout history accommodate people we label today as lesbian, gay, and transgendered; and calls on the Christian religion to acknowledge the Bible's many passages endorsing diversity in gender and sexuality. <i>Evolution's Rainbow </i>concludes with bold recommendations for improving education in biology, psychology, and medicine; for democratizing genetic engineering and medical practice; and for building a public monument to affirm diversity as one of our nation's defining principles.</p><p>"<i>Evolution's Rainbow </i>is an expansively creative challenge to the modern orthodoxies of sexual selection. Roughgarden's intellectual generosity may jump-start the careers of a new generation of diversity-affirming Darwinian scientists."&#x2015;Patricia Adair Gowaty, author of <i>Feminism and Evolutionary Biology </i><br><br>"An entrancing tale of sexual ambiguity in animals and people, but also that rarest of literary beasts&#x2015;a science book written from the heart."&#x2015;Steve Jones, author of <i>Darwin's Ghost </i><br><br>"A thoughtful and scholarly, yet deeply personal, perspective from a brilliant theoretical biologist. This articulate and provocative disquisition is must reading for anyone fascinated by one of the most important contemporary social challenges."&#x2015;Simon Levin, author of <i>Fragile Dominion</i><br><br>"This book challenges not only the assumptions about male-female differences in behavior and homosexual-heterosexual differences, but also the very meanings of &#x2018;maleness&#x2019; and &#x2018;femaleness&#x2019; in physical and biological terms. Roughgarden builds a strong case for biological diversity related to what humans call sex, gender, and sexuality."&#x2015;Bonnie Spanier, author of <i>Im/partial Science: Gender Ideology in Molecular Biology</i><br><br>"Joan Roughgarden asks, and indeed tries to answer, all the big questions about sexual diversity among humans and animals. She takes her readers on a wonderful journey through ecology and evolution and is a brilliant and talented narrator. <i>Evolution's Rainbow</i> will fundamentally change many ongoing conversations on sexuality and science."&#x2015;Judith Halberstam, author of <i>Female Masculinity</i><br><br>"Every now and then science focuses on a subject that matters. Gender and gender differences matter to us social primates. And we will judge, condemn, restrict or incarcerate people based on our notions of biologically normal variability in gender and sexuality. Thus, it is immensely important when a book comes along, written clearly and authoritatively by an eminent scientist, that demonstrates how wrong most people&#x2019;s ideas are about this subject.

An eleven-year-old heroine tells her unforgettable story with honesty, perceptivity, humor, and unselfconscious heroism. &#34;The honesty of thought and eye and feeling and word!&#34;--Eudora Welty; &#34;A lovely, breathtaking, sometimes heart-wrenching first novel.&#34;--Walker Percy. A Literary Guild Selection.</p><p><b>Oprah Book Club� Selection, October 1997</b>: Kaye Gibbons is a writer who brings a short story sensibility to her novels. Rather than take advantage of the novel's longer form to paint her visions in broad, sweeping strokes, Gibbons prefers to concentrate on just one corner of the canvas and only a few colors to produce her small masterpieces. In Gibbons's case, her canvas is the American South and her colors are all the shades of gray. <p> In <i>Ellen Foster</i>, the title character is an 11-year-old orphan who refers to herself as "old Ellen," an appellation that is disturbingly apt. Ellen is an old woman in a child's body; her frail, unhappy mother dies, her abusive father alternately neglects her and makes advances on her, and she is shuttled from one uncaring relative's home to another before she finally takes matters into her own hands and finds herself a place to belong. There is something almost Dickensian about Ellen's tribulations; like Oliver Twist, David Copperfield or a host of other literary child heroes, Ellen is at the mercy of predatory adults, with only her own wit and courage--and the occasional kindness of others--to help her through. That she does, in fact, survive her childhood and even rise above it is the book's bittersweet victory.</p><p>"When I was little I would think of ways to kill my daddy. I would figure out this or that way and run it down through my head until it got easy." </p><p>So begins the tale of Ellen Foster, the brave and engaging heroine of Kaye Gibbons's first novel, which won the Sue Kaufman Prize from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Wise, funny, affectionate and true, <i>Ellen Foster</i> is, as Walker Percy called it, "The real thing. Which is to say, a lovely, sometimes heart/wrenching novel...<i>[Ellen Foster]</i> is as much a part of the backwoods South as a Faulkner character and a good deal more endearing."</p></p><h2>Academic Encounters Level 3 Student&#39;s Book Reading and Writing: Life in Society</h2><p>The Academic Encounters Second edition series uses a sustained content approach to teach skills necessary for taking academic courses in English.

Consider &#34;Stars&#34;: &#34;How can I hope to be friends / with the hard white stars / whose flaring and hissing are not speech / but a pure radiance? / How can I hope to be friends / with the yawning spaces between them / where nothing, ever, is spoken?&#34; Yet Oliver does strike up a kind of friendship between nature&#39;s inexpressible beauty and the necessity and solace of language. She writes vividly of each, noting the way &#34;the sunlight and shadows are chasing each other,&#34; (from &#34;The Dog Has Run Off Again&#34;), in one instance, while elsewhere describing the excitement of writing poems: &#34;little curls little shafts / of letters words / little flames leaping&#34; (from &#34;Forty Years&#34;).

Bisel tells how she came to examine the skeletons in 1982, then introduces readers to a slave, ``Petronia,'' hours before the volcanic explosion. Bisel next reveals her conclusions, drawn from jewelry found with the skeletons and their bone structure, mineral content, etc. Readers are left to determine to what extent Petronia's story is fact- based, and how much is inference and/or interpretation. Shown in full-color photos complemented by artists' renderings of ancient times, these discoveries are fascinating. But the book's greatest strength is Bisel's manifest compassion for the objects of her study--even during the most reductive evaluations.

Almost to the end of the war, the Germans had firm faith in the Enigma ciphering machine, but in fact the codebreakers were deciphering nearly 4,000 German transmissions daily by 1942, reaping a wealth of information on such important matters as the effort to resupply Rommel's army in North Africa and the effect of Allied attempts to mislead the Germans about the location of D-Day landings. Indeed, Winston Churchill hailed the work of Bletchley Park as the "secret weapon" that won the war.<br> Only now, nearly half a century since the end of the Second World War, have any of the men and women in this group come forward to tell this remarkable story in their own words--a story that an oath of secrecy long prevented them from revealing. In <em>Codebreakers</em>, F.H. Hinsley and Alan Stripp have gathered together twenty-seven first-hand accounts of one of the most amazing feats in intelligence history. These engaging memoirs, each written by a different member of the codebreakers team, recount the long hours working in total secrecy and the feelings of camaraderie, tension, excitement, and frustration as these men and women, both British and American, did some of the most important work of the war. These talented people share not only their technical knowledge of cryptography and military logistics, but also poignant personal recollections as well. Walter Eytan, one of a handful of Jews at Betchley Park, recalls intercepting a message from a German vessel which reported that it carried Jews "<em>en route</em> for Piraeus <em>zur Endlosung</em> (for the final solution)." Eytan writes "I had never heard this expression before, but instinctively, I knew what it must mean, and I have never forgotten that moment." Vivienne Alford tells of her chilling memory of hearing that the atomic bomb had been dropped on Hiroshima, and the stillness that came over her and her co-workers in Naval Section VI. And William Millward confides that he is still haunted by the work he did in Hut 3 nearly fifty years ago. "I sometimes wonder, especially during the night, how many sailors I drowned."<br> Few readers will finish this book without feeling that the codebreakers were essential to the outcome of the war--and thereby of major importance in helping to shape the world we live in today.<br></p><p><br><strong>F.H. Hinsley</strong> was formerly Master of St John's College and Professor of the History of International Relations at the University of Cambridge. He is the author of the four-volume history British Intelligence in the Second World War. <br><br><strong>Alan Stripp</strong> is Director of Cambridge University Summer Schools on British Secret Services.<br>"A fascinating and unique book.

These new forms of church gather and network with people who typically have never been to church. The new faith communities listen to people and go where they are on the journey toward Jesus. They are deeply ecumenical but do not lose their distinctiveness because they learn fresh ways to communicate their identity through discipleship.<br> <br> <em>Fresh Expressions</em> began in the United Kingdom where it ignited over 3000 new faith communities. In the United States the movement is putting down roots in Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Florida. <br> <br> Ken Carter and Audrey Warren offer this book as a group study for church leaders and congregations who are in the grip of Holy Spirit motivation to renew their tradition by reaching people who are dechurched or not yet in a discipleship relationship with Jesus. <br> <br> Each chapter includes two Bible study experiences for group conversation.</p> <p>"I have been an observer of and cheerleader for the Fresh Expressions movement ... from the beginning, and I've lamented how slow US congregations have been to welcome and adapt this movement for our setting. Now, as an admirer and ally of the United Methodist mission of making disciples of Jesus Christ for the transformation of the world, I am thrilled to see Fresh Expressions gaining this hearing in United Methodism in the United States. May thousands of congregations be inspired and equipped by Audrey Warren and Kenneth Carter's new book!" - Brian D. McLaren, author of The Great Spiritual Migration</p> <p>"I was most fortunate to have Ken Carter and Audrey Warren as my guides as we explored Fresh Expressions of Church all across England. Now you are fortunate enough to have them lead you on a similar journey through the pages of this book. I hope you will be as excited as I was to find Church as I always dreamed it could be, moving outside the walls of sanctuaries and radically following the Holy Spirit's lead to new spaces and new people. This is the Church of Acts and the early Methodists. I hope it is also the Church of the twenty-first century.&nbsp; Enjoy your journey!" --Sue Haupert-Johnson, Resident Bishop of the North Georgia Episcopal Area, The United Methodist Church<br> <br> &#x201c;If you&#x2019;ve felt God calling your church into a new kind of mission but you haven&#x2019;t been sure how to go about it &#x2014; this book is a great place to start.

They were the last recorded group of Africans deported to the United States as slaves. Timothy Meaher, an established Mobile businessman, sent the slave ship, the <em>Clotilda</em> , to Africa, on a bet that he could "bring a shipful of niggers right into Mobile Bay under the officers' noses." He won the bet.<br> <br> This book reconstructs the lives of the people in West Africa, recounts their capture and passage in the slave pen in Ouidah, and describes their experience of slavery alongside American-born enslaved men and women. After emancipation, the group reunited from various plantations, bought land, and founded their own settlement, known as African Town. They ruled it according to customary African laws, spoke their own regional language and, when giving interviews, insisted that writers use their African names so that their families would know that they were still alive.<br> <br> The last survivor of the <em>Clotilda</em> died in 1935, but African Town is still home to a community of <em>Clotilda</em> descendants. The publication of <em>Dreams of Africa in Alabama</em> marks the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.<br> <br> Winner of the Wesley-Logan Prize of the American Historical Association (2007)<br></p><p><br><strong>Sylviane A.

Highly recommended."--T.F. Armstrong, <em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br>"A compelling and often tragic narrative of survival and adaptation. It makes it clear that the Atlantic slave trade was not only a part of a 'distant' history of the United States, but that it also continued to shape our country long after it was officially abolished two centuries ago."--Lisa A. Lindsay, <em>African Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"Diouf's book makes a significant contribution to the history of race and identity in Alabama and the Atlantic world."--Timothy R.

The narrative is at once tragic, uplifting, and engrossing."--Loren Schweninger, co-author of <em>In Search of the Promised Land: A Slave Family in the Old South</em><p></p><br>"An amazing story! Diouf shows how the African captives on the last American slave ship not only survived slavery, the civil war, and reconstruction in Alabama, but also fought to preserve African memories, culture, and community. The exhaustive research and graceful writing of Sylviane Diouf has brought this epic journey to life."--Robert Harms, author of <em>The Diligent: A Voyage through the Worlds of the Slave Trade</em><p></p><br>"In a tale worthy of a novelist, Sylviane Diouf provides a well-researched, nicely written, and moving account of the last slave ship to America, whose 110 captives arrived in Mobile in 1860 and, after the war, created their dream of Africa in Alabama and called it Africa Town."--Howard Jones, author of <em>Mutiny on the Amistad</em><p></p><br>"Without question, this is the richest narration of the history of the last set of African slaves who came to the United States. The book carefully illustrates how they they were able to construct a semi-independent existence, navigating the treacherous experience of bondage during the Civil War years and of the constricted freedom that followed. Not only do we gain access to precious, invaluable details about how the marginalized made their own history, we receive additional profound knowledge of the process through which African practices were retained."--Toyin Falola, University of Texas, and Fellow of the Nigerian Academy of Letters<p></p><br>"<em>Dreams of Africa in Alabama</em> is an excellent example of the new scholarship on the African diaspora that reconstructs the individual life stories of enslaved Africans--in this case the people brought from West Africa to Alabama in 1860 on the Clotilda. Diouf has sensitively revealed how these people built on their shared misfortune in being enslaved to form the vibrant community of African Town in the midst of an increasingly racist society, a testimony to unshakeable memories of their African homelands."--Paul E. Lovejoy, Harriet Tubman Research Institute, York University<p></p><br>"<em>Dreams of Africa in Alabama</em> stands as a moving memorial to the indomitable spirit of a small group of Africans who managed to maintain their dignity and their humanity on an unfamiliar and often hostile shore."--<em>Mobile Press-Register</em><p></p><br>"<em>Dreams of Africa in Alabama</em> is more than a gripping slave story. Few historians have succeeded to the extent that Diouf has in presenting a fully fleshed picture of the experience of Africans negotiating life in America...A valuable and impressive addition to the literature of slavery and emancipation in American history."--Donna L.

A new chapter, 15, develops the subject of relativistic waves, beginning with a review of basic relativistic concepts and continues with derivation of the Klein-Gordon equation. The chapter delves into the Dirac theory and the Dirac formulation of the four-dimensional spin operator, and concludes with a brief introduction to the covariant formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics. The revision also includes new descriptions and discussions of quantum-well configurations relevant to the quantum dot and the quantum wire and pertinent to semiconductor technology. Employing an assortment of symmetry principles, the transfer matrix method is developed and employed to regain the Kronig-Penny dispersion relation. The discussion of impurity semiconductors has been revised and is accompanied by a new subsection on the p-n junction. A new description of the Hartree-Fock model is included in the revision, which affords a method for obtaining approximate atomic wavefunctions and eigenenergies. This description complements the Thomas-Fermi model, which was new to the second edition. The third edition of Introductory Quantum Mechanics also includes a number of new intriguing problems many of which carry solutions, and a new, informative periodic chart appearing on the inside flap of the front cover. As with his previous editions, Liboff starts with a review of the most relevant elements of classical mechanics and proceeds through two parts that develop quantum theory.</p><p>Careful and detailed explanations of challenging concepts, and comprehensive and up-to-date coverage in this best-selling quantum mechanics book, continue to set the standard in physics education. In this new edition, a new chapter on the revolutionary topic of of quantum computing (not currently covered in any other book at this level) and thorough updates to the rest of the book bring it up to date.

In this his hands-on, friendly guide readers will get access to a leading coding tool that has been designed specifically for kids, showing them how to create the projects provided in the book as well as how to implement them into their own creative work.</p> <p>Written by a teacher and leading advocate of coding education, <i>Coding For Kids For Dummies</i> explains to kids in plain English how to apply the math and logic skills they already have to the subject of coding. In no time, they'll be grasping basic coding concepts, completing their very own technical feats, and arming themselves with the computer science experience and know-how to prepare for a future working with technology.</p> <ul> <li>Lay-flat binding allows for easy access as students work on projects</li> <li>Full-color, large-print design make the information more approachable to kids</li> <li>Kids interested in computer science get a competitive edge</li> <li>The author has dedicated her career to enhancing coding and other STEM education in schools</li> </ul> <p>If you're a student who wants to learn coding, a parent who wants to help your kid pursue an interest in coding, or a teacher who is in need of a supplemental course book for your computer science class, <i>Coding For Kids For Dummies</i> has you covered.</p></p><p><b>Everyone Can Code!</b><br><br>Learning to code is something every kid can do, and it should be a fun, creative experience. &nbsp;There are so, so, so, many programming languages with which you can begin -- Scratch, JavaScript, Python, App Inventor -- but I am personally a fan of MicroWorlds EX, the language I use in this book. &nbsp;Diehard computer programmers may ask, "WHY?!?!? -- that's a teaching language." &nbsp;That's true! &nbsp;It's a Logo language developed originally by Seymour Papert of MIT. &nbsp;Many K-12 schools and even some universities, including Stanford (in the Transformative Learning Technologies Lab), introduce students to coding using MicroWorlds, StarLogo and other Logo languages because they build the programming foundations AND spark the confidence and curiosity needed to keep new coders engaged.<br><br>I love&nbsp;MicroWorlds EX because it features a large workspace for designing your app's GUI, fun graphic design tools, a built-in compiler/interpreter, simple dialog boxes and palettes, and a pane for writing procedural code -- all in one place. &nbsp;It's a step up in complexity over Scratch (because, like in "real" coding, kids actually have to type using correct vocabulary and syntax), but it preserves the easy ability to create graphics, execute code, and obtain debugging clues. &nbsp;It's also simple to install MicroWorlds EX, and once installed, kids don't need access to the Internet to code. &nbsp;<br><br>The book is stuffed full of fun projects from games to simulations, and it comes with a free, downloadable trial of MicroWorlds EX -- 35 days. Kids who focus on one book Part each week will find they have sufficient time to sample key concepts and complete the projects that most appeal to them. &nbsp;If, by working through the projects, kids find they love programming (and I hope they do!), then purchase of the book and use of the trial will have motivated them to expand their horizons, trying new projects and also new languages. &nbsp;For kids who find they love MicroWorlds EX like I do, they can obtain a deep discount on a forever version of the software ($29 as opposed to the standard $99). For kids who want to craft projects in a free programming language, many of the ideas in the book can be adapted for creation in Scratch and other Logo-based languages. Regardless of which programming language your young coders work in, I hope they find the project ideas presented in this little book fun, instructive, and motivational for writing their own code and developing their own cool projects.&nbsp;<br><br>My heart leaps when I see students bring the ideas out of their heads and into the world, creating digital artifacts through coding and physical ones through making. &nbsp;It's an amazing time to be a kid, and I applaud the adults who are working hard to support this next generation of ingenious inventors!<ul> <li>Create Games and Apps</li> <li>Customize Your Projects</li> <li>Learn Real Coding Skills</li> </ul> <p><b><i>A coding book for kids!</i></b></p> <p>Do you know how to write code to create your own computer games and applications?

Today, trade blankets are collectibles, especially those that were made prior to World War II. Language of the Robe identifies, classifies, and presents the history of the trade blanket. Within the tribe or pueblo, the blanket is a statement of an individual&#39;s bond to the older, traditional ways, to roots that run deep. As a gift, the blanket is an important acknowledgement of friendship, gratitude and respect. Bright colors and intricately woven patterns are the hallmarks of the American Indian trade blankets. Even though the blankets were commercially produced by companies such as the famous Pendleton Woolen Mills, they were embraced by Native American peoples across the country and became an integral part of their culture and ceremonies.

K. Chesterton &#39;&#34;A man&#39;s brain is a bomb,&#34; he cried out, loosening suddenly his strange passion and striking his own skull with violence. &#34;My brain feels like a bomb, night and day. It must expand! It must expand! A man&#39;s brain must expand, if it breaks up the universe&#34;&#39; In a park in London, secret policeman Gabriel Syme strikes up a conversation with an anarchist. Sworn to do his duty, Syme uses his new acquaintance to go undercover in Europe&#39;s Central Anarchist Council and infiltrate their deadly mission, even managing to have himself voted to the position of &#39;Thursday&#39;. When Syme discovers another undercover policeman on the Council, however, he starts to question his role in their operations. And as a desperate chase across Europe begins, his confusion grows, as well as his confidence in his ability to outwit his enemies. But he has still to face the greatest terror that the Council has: a man named Sunday, whose true nature is worse than Syme could ever have imagined ... The Penguin English Library - 100 editions of the best fiction in English, from the eighteenth century and the very first novels to the beginning of the First World War.</p><p>In an article published the day before his death, G.K. Chesterton called <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> "a very melodramatic sort of moonshine." Set in a phantasmagoric London where policemen are poets and anarchists camouflage themselves as, well, anarchists, his 1907 novel offers up one highly colored enigma after another. If that weren't enough, the author also throws in an elephant chase and a hot-air-balloon pursuit in which the pursuers suffer from "the persistent refusal of the balloon to follow the roads, and the still more persistent refusal of the cabmen to follow the balloon." <p> But Chesterton is also concerned with more serious questions of honor and truth (and less serious ones, perhaps, of duels and dualism). Our hero is Gabriel Syme, a policeman who cannot reveal that his fellow poet Lucian Gregory is an anarchist. In Chesterton's agile, antic hands, Syme is the virtual embodiment of paradox: </p><blockquote> He came of a family of cranks, in which all the oldest people had all the newest notions. One of his uncles always walked about without a hat, and another had made an unsuccessful attempt to walk about with a hat and nothing else. His father cultivated art and self-realization; his mother went in for simplicity and hygiene. Hence the child, during his tenderer years, was wholly unacquainted with any drink between the extremes of absinthe and cocoa, of both of which he had a healthy dislike.... Being surrounded with every conceivable kind of revolt from infancy, Gabriel had to revolt into something, so he revolted into the only thing left--sanity. </blockquote> Elected undercover into the Central European Council of anarchists, Syme must avoid discovery <i>and</i> save the world from any bombings in the offing. As Thursday (each anarchist takes the name of a weekday--the only quotidian thing about this fantasia) does his best to undo his new colleagues, the masks multiply. The question then becomes: Do they reveal or conceal? And who, not to mention what, can be believed? As <i>The Man Who Was Thursday</i> proceeds, it becomes a hilarious numbers game with a more serious undertone--what happens if most members of the council actually turn out to be on the side of right? Chesterton's tour de force is a thriller that is best read slowly, so as to savor his highly anarchic take on anarchy. <i>--Kerry Fried</i>G. K. Chesterton&#39;s surreal masterpiece is a psychological thriller that centers on seven anarchists in turn-of-the-century London who call themselves by the names of the days of the week. Chesterton explores the meanings of their disguised identities in what is a fascinating mystery and, ultimately, a spellbinding allegory. As Jonathan Lethem remarks in his Introduction, The real characters are the ideas. Chesterton&#39;s nutty agenda is really quite simple: to expose moral relativism and parlor nihilism for the devils he believes them to be. This wouldn&#39;t be interesting at all, though, if he didn&#39;t also show such passion for giving the devil his due. He animates the forces of chaos and anarchy with every ounce of imaginative verve and rhetorical force in his body.</p><h2>Brokenness</h2><p>Brokenness. This is where true revival of the heart begins. In this compelling book, Nancy Leigh DeMoss draws readers to a deeper understanding of biblical brokenness. While some may think of it as a sad and gloomy emotional state, Nancy says emphatically,&#39;No.&#39; It&#39;s not how we feel, but a choice we make. It is in this place of humility and contrition before a holy God that we experience true restoration of our hearts.</p><p><i>Do you need a fresh encounter with God?&nbsp; Are you ready for Him to pour out His grace on the dry, thirsty ground of your heart?</i><br><br> Nancy DeMoss has discovered an irrefutable spiritual principle: before every great movement of God there is always a time of deep repentance. Here is her moving, true account of how God created that brokenness in others--and the astonishing revival that followed.<br> &nbsp;<b>NANCY LEIGH DEMOSS</b> is the author of fifteen books, including the bestselling <i>Lies Women Believe</i> and <i>Choosing Forgiveness</i>.

Covering the period from Portugal's early conception as a nation through its long history, with emphasis on the dramatic period of the last several decades, this volume culminates with the demise of the Salazar dictatorship and the independence of its colonies. Complete with a timeline for easy reference to events, brief biographies of important people, lists of monarchs and heads of state, and a bibliographic essay, it is the ideal companion for the student or interested reader.</p><p></p><p>In nine chapters, Anderson discusses the geography of Portugal, its prehistoric antecedents, its formation as a nation, and the events that once made it a world leader in exploration, discovery, and imperial power. How and why the country was drawn into the orbit of its large neighbor, Spain, lost much of its empire, and yet managed to regain its independence are examined, along with the trials and tribulations encountered on its journey from monarchy to modern republic. The discussion presents the factors that kept Portugal one of the poorest nations in Europe for most of its existence and the reasons that it is now, leading into the 21st century, closing the economic gap with wealthier nations.</p></p><p><p>JAMES M.

Jack Zipes, one of our surest guides through the world of fairy tales and their criticism, takes us behind the romantic mythology of the wandering brothers. Bringing to bear his own critical expertise as well as new biographical information, Zipes examines the interaction between the Grimms&#39; lives and their work. He reveals their personal struggle to overcome social prejudice and poverty, as well as their political efforts -- as scholars and civil servants -- toward unifying the German states. By deftly interweaving the social, political, and personal elements of their lives, Zipes rescues the Brothers Grimm from sentimental obscurity. No longer figures in a fairy tale, the Brothers Grimm emerge as powerful creators, real men who established the fairy tale as one of our great literary institutions. Part biography, part critical assessment, and part social history, The Brothers Grimm provides a complex and very real story about fairy tales and the modern world.</p><p>Jack Zipes is Professor Emeritus of German and Comparative Literature at the University of Minnesota, USA. He is the author, translator, and editor of dozens of studies and collections of folk and fairy tales. His recent books include &#34;Why Fairy Tales Stick: The Evolution and Relevance of a Genre, &#34;Relentless Progress: The Reconfiguration of Children&#39;s Literature, Fairy Tales, and Storytelling,&#34; and &#34;The Enchanted Screen: The Unknown History of Fairy-Tale Films.&#34;Zipes is probably the leading American authority on the fairy tale, which makes this new edition of his classic study of the Brothers Grimm (1988) especially welcome. Zipes has significantly revised and expanded his book, responding both to its earlier critics and to the wealth of new work on the Grimms to come out of East Germany since the fall of the Berlin Wall. He is concerned with both the artistry and the ideology of the tales. While agreeing that the Grimms often transformed their tales to reflect the bourgeois values of their world, Zipes wishes to avoid simplistic readings, exploring the complexity of what such values actually meant. At the same time, Zipes is interested in their later reception and appropriation, including the efforts of Disney. His new chapter on the legacy of the Grimms in East and West Germany is especially illuminating. Highly recommended.<br><i>T.L.

The novel details the militant campaign of the suffragist Women&#x2019;s Social and Political Union against the political establishment of the time. Through its three female protagonists, each from a different class, the novel recounts the challenges faced by women who dared to flout social convention by agitating for the vote. The Sally of the title is Sally Simmonds, a maid-of-all-work in a household where she has to deal with her employer&#x2019;s advances along with her daily tasks. The novel follows Sally&#x2019;s conversion to the suffrage movement and details the consequences she must face as a working-class woman who risks her job, her relationships, and eventually her life for the cause. </p> <p> The novel weaves together the fictional stories of the three main characters with documentary material drawn from contemporary suffrage and mainstream newspapers, and raises the hope that female alliances might someday transcend class boundaries.

The new Fourth Edition, while maintaining this focus, has been completely reformatted and updated. <p>The emphasis, as before, is on experiments, and on the way they are carried out. Using a narrative approach, the authors follow a line from the original inception of a new idea to an account of research being done today. The wealth of new facts, techniques, and concepts, however, presented a challenge in keeping the book to a manageable size. Inevitably, the authors have had to delete descriptions of certain classical experiments. </p><p>Largely in response to readers' comments, elements of format and presentation have been changed for this new edition&#x2014;more headings have been introduced, the paragraphs are shorter, and the illustrations, now in full color, have been clarified. As in previous editions, references are cited throughout the text, and appendices are provided to help readers unfamiliar with the nervous system deal with essential facts and definitions. </p><p>Intended for use in upper-level undergraduate, graduate, psychology, and medical school Neuroscience courses, From Neuron to Brain will be of interest to anyone, with or without a specialized background in biological sciences, who is curious about the workings of the nervous system. It presents a readable and coherent account of how cellular and molecular approaches can provide insights into the workings of the brain.</p></p><p>JOHN G. NICHOLLS, SISSA, Trieste, Italy. - PAUL A.

Paul Feyerabend's <i>Three Dialogues on Knowledge</i> resurrects the form to provide an astonishingly flexible and invigorating analysis of epistemological, ethical and metaphysical problems. He uses literary strategies - of irony, voice and distance - to make profoundly philosophical points about the epistemic, existential and political aspects of common sense and scientific knowledge. He writes about ancient and modern relativism; the authority of science; the ignorance of scientists; the nature of being; and true and false enlightenment. <p>Throughout <i>Three Dialogues on Knowledge</i> is provocative, controversial and inspiring. It is, unlike most current philosophical writing, written for readers with a keen sense of what matters and why.</p></p><p><b>Paul K. Feyerabend</b> (1924-1994) was professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, and Professor of the Philosophy of Science at the Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich. He was previously Professor of Philosophy at Yale University, the Free University of Berlin, University College, London, and the University of Auckland, New Zealand.

The side streets and markets of Paris come alive with anecdotes about traditional recipes and the daily shopping. Each chapter takes a trip to a different part of the market, with descriptions of the shopkeepers and their goods. And more than 150 recipes document the meals that many Parisians know by heart and consider their daily fare.<p>This isn't fancy restaurant cooking that is difficult to duplicate in the home kitchen, but rather wholesome, easy-to-make recipes, most of which take less than thirty minutes to prepare. Take your pick from Smothered Duck Legs and Apples, Baked Tomatoes with Pesto, and Stuffed Cod with Asparagus. Indulge yourself in Lamb and Red Bean Stew, Tuna Braised in Sherry with Rosemary, or Parisian Bread Pudding. From cover to cover, <em>Parisian Home Cooking</em> is a delicious way to bring a bit of everyday Paris into your own home.</p><p></p></p><p>Picture for a moment a package of salmon steaks wrapped in plastic, labeled with a price sticker, and put out on display with the rest of the shrink-wrapped seafood in your neighborhood giant supermarket. Or for that matter, picture yourself racing through the supermarket, getting the food shopping over with as quickly and as sanely as possible. This is the opposite of Michael Roberts' <i>Parisian Home Cooking</i>, a cookbook as much about attitude as actual food.<p> Through artful recipes and engaging street photography, Roberts brings to life a culinary Paris found in private homes, a cuisine with a different sense of rhythm than anything American. Lunches are longer. Dinners are later. Shopping for the best ingredients imaginable is an interpersonal experience to be savored. "The charm of a French meal," Roberts writes, "is their insistence on quality ingredients and balanced flavor, in respecting those ingredients by not overcomplicating the cooking...." </p><p> To take this book to heart in an American city, Roberts suggests we "make marketing an adventure." To this end he finds himself making full use of ethnic markets and groceries, buying fish from Japanese markets, fresh poultry in Chinese markets, and so on. "The Indian grocery is where I buy chickpea flour for making socca, a Ni�oise crepe.... Don't think that you need access to a French market or gourmet emporium to cook French food."</p><p> That said, prepare for the likes of Senegalese Salt Cod Fritters, Cream of Sorrel Soup, Escarole Salad with Mustard Vinaigrette, Green Beans and Morels, Scallops with Noodles and Basil, Turkey Cutlets with Sage and Lemon Butter, Braised Rabbit with Mustard and Calvados, Roasted Turnips with Sage, and Spiced Poached Peaches.</p><p> Roberts divides his book into the traditional courses of a French meal, starting with little things to nibble and encourage an appetite, and ending with dessert. Traveling the pages in between takes the casual visitor deep into the heart of Parisian markets, then back home to a small kitchen filled with the heart-healing aromas of a simple, divine meal, Parisian style. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p><p>Michael Roberts is the fashion and style director of <em>Vanity Fair</em>.

He was the editor of the first volume of San Francisco Noir.This classics entry in Akashic's noir anthology series boasts an impressive roster of names, including such standard authors as Mark Twain, Jack London, Ambrose Bierce and Dashiell Hammett. Unsurprisingly, Hammett, one of the fathers of American hard-boiled fiction, supplies the best story, The Scorched Face, which sets his Continental Op on the trail of two missing women. Marcia Muller's Deceptions makes good use of the Golden Gate Bridge's appeal to potential suicides in a short but gripping exploit of her series PI, Sharon McCone. Readers looking for lesser-known talent will welcome Janet Dawson's Invisible Time, which presents a grim view of life on the streets for two young people. Don Herron's gritty Knives in the Dark, with its Chandler-like plot line, convincingly depicts Prohibition-era tough guys. As usual, the overall caliber of the writing in this reprint volume is superior to the average all-original book in the series. <i>(Feb.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With ample humor and insight, Epstein uncovers the new outlets upon which the old snobbery has fastened: food and wine, fashion, high-achieving children, schools, politics, health, being with-it, name-dropping, and much else, including the roles of Jews and homosexuals in the development of snobbery. He also raises the question of whether snobbery might, alas, be a part of human nature. Snobbery: The American Versionis the first book in English devoted exclusively to the subject since Thackeray&#39;s THE BOOK OF SNOBS.</p><p>JOSEPH EPSTEIN is the author of the best-selling Snobbery and of Friendship, among other books, and was formerly editor of the American Scholar. His work has appeared in The New Yorker, Harper&#x2019;s Magazine, the Atlantic Monthly, and other magazines. He lives in Evanston, Illinois.1<br>It Takes One to Know One<br><br>Rather than imply his superiority to his subject, the author of a <br>book about snobbery ought to set out, fairly briefly, his own <br>experience of snobbery. He ought to let his readers know if he has <br>been a victim of snobbery, and of the sorts of snobbery to which he <br>is susceptible, to allow them to judge his own relationship to the <br>subject.<br> Perhaps the best way for me to begin, then, is to explain my <br>social origins. These are a bit complicated. They seem to have been <br>culturally lower middle class but with middle- and, later, upper-<br>middle-class financial backing. Neither of my parents went to <br>college. My father, growing up in Canada, in fact never finished high <br>school; my mother took what was then known as "the commercial course" <br>at John Marshall (public) High School in Chicago. They were both <br>Jewish, but, against the positive stereotype of Jews loving culture <br>and things of the mind, my parents had almost no cultural interests <br>apart from occasionally going to musical comedies or, in later years, <br>watching the Boston Pops on television. Magazines &#x2014; Life, Look, later <br>Time &#x2014; and local newspapers came into our apartment, but no books. I <br>don"t recall our owning an English dictionary, though both my parents <br>were well spoken, always grammatical and jargon-free.<br> Politics was not a great subject of family conversation. The <br>behavior of our extended family and neighbors, money, my father"s <br>relations with customers at his business, these made up the main <br>conversational fare &#x2014; unspeculative, nonhypothetical, all very <br>specific. Education was another subject of little interest; no time <br>was spent, say, discussing the differences between Amherst and <br>Williams colleges, for the good reason that neither of my parents had <br>ever heard of such places.<br> My father, I believe, hadn"t a speck of snobbery. It would <br>not have occurred to him to want to rise socially in the world, and <br>the only people he looked down upon &#x2014; apart from crooks of one kind <br>or another &#x2014; were people who seemed to be without the ambition to <br>take measured risks in business. We had a distant cousin who was a <br>lieutenant colonel in the U.S. Army, and my father was baffled by the <br>notion of a Jewish man settling for a career in the regular army. It <br>pleased my father to give ample sums to charities (many of them <br>Jewish charities) and, in later years, to travel to foreign <br>countries &#x2014; once, with my mother, to Paris on the Concorde and back <br>from London on the QE2. Above all, it pleased him to have made enough <br>money to help out his family and be able to establish his financial <br>independence, which he did at the age of seventeen. But he barely <br>acknowledged the social realm in which snobbery takes place. For him <br>the world of status, where style, rank, and social climbing were <br>central, was a mystery he felt no need to fathom.<br> My mother, though no snob either, had a greater awareness of <br>snobbery. She was on the alert for snobberies used against her, and <br>could be vulnerable to them. In her friendships she sought out women <br>who were goodhearted, for she was goodhearted and generous herself. <br>She also had an unashamed taste for what, by her standard, passed for <br>luxe, which meant driving big cars (Cadillacs), owning lavish <br>furniture, dressing well (furs, expensive dresses, Italian shoes, <br>jewelry). She was made a bit nervous by people who had more money <br>than she, and tended to arrange her social life among people who were <br>her financial equals or inferiors. But I never saw my mother &#x2014; or my <br>father &#x2014; commit a single socially mean act: I never saw them fawn <br>over anyone better off than they, or put down anyone beneath them for <br>reasons one would think to call snobbish.<br> Why, then, did the eldest of their two sons, the author of <br>this book, have so keen a sense, almost from the outset of his <br>consciousness, of the various arrangements that make for snobbery: <br>social class, money, taste, religion, admired attainments, status of <br>all kinds. As a small boy, I sensed who was richer than whom, noted <br>people who lived more grandly and more poorly than we, immediately <br>grasped what excited the envy of others, felt stirrings of incipient <br>envy of my own. Where this came from I cannot even now say, but it <br>was, beyond argument, in place. Nor, to this day, has it ever left me.<br> When men gathered in my parents" apartment to talk about <br>world affairs, I could not help noticing that the wealthier ones <br>generally did most of the talking, or at least talked most <br>authoritatively and were listened to most closely. A pleasant man <br>named Sam Cowling, living in the apartment building next to ours, was <br>a comedian on a popular radio show called The Breakfast Club, and <br>this, clearly, lent him a certain allure. Money and celebrity, I <br>early recognized, counted for quite a bit in the world. Some work in <br>life carried greater prestige than other work &#x2014; as in baseball, <br>shortstop was a more admired position than second base, and in <br>football, quarterback was more admired than interior lineman.<br> In grammar school I was able to arrange to play both <br>shortstop and quarterback. I also became a fair tennis player, a <br>sport with all sorts of interesting connections to snobbery, from its <br>then country-club settings to its emphasis on stylishness, which <br>tends to vaunt appearance over reality &#x2014; a phenomenon at the heart of <br>much snobbery.<br> I went to a high school where status was spelled out with a <br>brute clarity I have not since encountered elsewhere. At Nicholas <br>Senn High School on the North Side of Chicago, status was at least as <br>carefully calibrated as at the court of the Sun King at Versailles, <br>though the food was less good and the clothing nowhere near so <br>elegant. The school had roughly fifty clubs, fraternities, and <br>sororities for boys and for girls, each with its own colorful <br>jackets. Some had Greek-letter names &#x2014; Alpha, Beta, Delta; some had <br>the names of animals, real and mythological &#x2014; Ravens, Condors, <br>Gargoyles; some had names with aristocratic shadings &#x2014; Dukes, <br>Majestics, Imperials, Gentry; some had neologisms for names &#x2014; <br>Raynors, Chiquitas, Fidels, Iaetas. But each club, each fraternity <br>and sorority had a social character that was distinct and apparent to <br>the student body: this club represented the best athletes, this <br>sorority the cutest girls, this fraternity the most fearsome thugs, <br>this the dreariest nerds ("science bores," we called them).<br> It didn"t take me long &#x2014; perhaps a couple of months at the <br>outside &#x2014; to decode all these groups with their various social <br>gradations. Because I had in those days a superficial charm that <br>allowed me to make friends easily, I was soon invited to join the <br>best of the clubs and fraternities, which meant those whose members <br>were among the best athletes and most socially fluent of the school"s <br>male students. The ease with which I was able to do this may have <br>left me a touch jaded. Sufficiently so, at any rate, so that during <br>my senior year in high school I was invited to join a boys" honor <br>society called Green &amp; White and turned it down, perhaps the first <br>boy in the history of the school to do so. I didn"t want it, I didn"t <br>need it, and, besides, I understood that turning it down would confer <br>greater status upon me than accepting it. From a fairly early age, <br>then, I was a fairly cunning statustician.<br> Because I was not an uninterested student, and because my <br>family had no knowledge of the social and financial implications of <br>attending the better American colleges and universities &#x2014; which for <br>snobbish reasons remain, I believe, considerable &#x2014; I went to the <br>University of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana, which in those days had, <br>for residents of the state, an open-enrollment policy and low fees. <br>Illinois turned out to be one of the most Greek &#x2014; that is, most <br>fraternity- and sorority-ridden &#x2014; campuses in the United States. With <br>my small talent for making myself acceptable, I arranged to be <br>invited to join the best Jewish fraternity on campus. (And let me add <br>that &#x2014; with a feeling of slight shame cannot shake off even now, more <br>than forty years later &#x2014; I left behind my two best friends, who were <br>not invited to join the same fraternity.) I italicize the word Jewish <br>not only because the fraternity"s membership was exclusively made up <br>of Jews, but because fraternities and sororities during the middle <br>1950s were strictly segregated by religion, with almost all Gentile <br>fraternities and sororities not accepting Jews and some not <br>permitting Catholics to become members.<br> Here I ought to underscore that my being Jewish may well have <br>increased my sensitivity to the realm of snobbery. Although an <br>agnostic in religion, my father was keen on sniffing out anti-<br>Semitism, having lived with a great deal of it among the Quebecois in <br>Montreal when he was a boy and then through the nightmare that Hitler <br>created during World War Two. One of his few repeated and heavily <br>emphasized lessons to me was to be on the qui vive for anti-Semitism, <br>which could crop up anywhere. "People might hate you," he said, "for <br>no better reason than your name. Be careful. Stay on the alert." Anti-<br>Semitism may itself be the first and perhaps the longest lasting and <br>most virulent form of snobbery, though when stepped up to the level <br>of pogroms, not to say genocide, it becomes, like racism, something <br>much greater than mere snobbery.<br> Given all this, I never found myself much upset by the <br>religious segregation practiced in the Middle West in the years I <br>grew up there. That Jews were not wanted in Gentile fraternities at <br>the University of Illinois was not in the least troubling to me. <br>Jewish snobbishness of its own, reinforced by Jewish chauvinism, <br>doubtless kicked in (who needs them!), but I never felt it a serious <br>social deprivation not to be able to join any fraternity or country <br>club, or even live in certain then Judenrein, or restricted, <br>neighborhoods or suburbs in and around Chicago, of which there were <br>quite a few.<br> I soon became bored by this fraternity and what seemed to me <br>its rather pathetic social aspirations. Chief among these was the <br>hope of joining forces with a high-status Gentile sorority in a <br>musical-comedy sketch called Stunt Show. I was, in fact, about to <br>change radically the status system under which I operated, then and <br>forever. After a year at the University of Illinois, I applied to and <br>was accepted at the University of Chicago, which turned out to be an <br>entirely different kettle of caviar.<br> Mike Nichols, the movie director and former comedian, who was <br>at the University of Chicago roughly four years before I went there &#x2014; <br>pity he didn"t attend later, so that I might have known him and thus <br>dropped his name, a good one, at this point &#x2014; Mike Nichols has <br>said, "Everyone at the University of Chicago was neurotic, weird, <br>strange &#x2014; it was paradise." I"m not so sure about the paradise part, <br>but about the neurotic, weird, and strange no argument is possible. <br>One of the most astonishing things of all was that life at Chicago <br>was not founded on status &#x2014; which is also to say, on snobbery &#x2014; at <br>least not as I had been hitherto accustomed to it. People were not <br>ranked by physical beauty, or athletic skill, or wealth, or family <br>connections. None of these things seemed to matter. All that did was <br>intelligence &#x2014; or, more precisely, intellectuality, which I would <br>define as the ability to deal in a sophisticated way with the issues, <br>questions, and problems presented by art, science, politics, and <br>things of the mind generally. Since my own intellectual quality was <br>then of a low order, my status as a student at the University of <br>Chicago was commensurately low. Hiding my ignorance as best I could, <br>I looked on, fascinated. Here was a new game, and one I felt, if then <br>still somewhat inchoately, I wanted to play.<br> The University of Chicago, I was to discover, had its own <br>built-in status system. No one announced what it was, but anyone at <br>all attentive couldn"t fail to note that in this system only four <br>kinds of work in life had any standing. These were: to be an artist; <br>to be a scientist (and not some dopey physician, treating people for <br>flu or urological problems &#x2014; only a research physician qualified); to <br>be a statesman (of which there were none then extant); or &#x2014; and here <br>was the loophole &#x2014; to be a teacher of potential artists, scientists, <br>and statesmen. To be anything else, no matter how great one"s <br>financial or professional success, was to be rabble, just another <br>commoner, a natural slave (in Aristotle"s term), out there struggling <br>under the blazing sun with the only shade available that provided by <br>Plato"s cave for the uninitiated ignorant.<br> Henceforth the snobbish system under which I would operate <br>would be artistic, intellectual, cultural. Had I gone to Harvard, <br>Princeton, or Yale (unlikely, since the latter two schools in those <br>days had strict quotas against Jews, and, besides, my mediocre grades <br>would not have qualified me for entrance), I might have adopted <br>snobbery of a social kind, though, so barren of social distinction <br>was the family I grew up in, this would not have been easy to bring <br>off without extraordinarily thin pretensions. Meanwhile, artistic, <br>intellectual, and cultural snobbery gave me quite enough to do. I <br>began to think of myself as an intellectual and a highbrow, <br>interested in art only in its exalted forms. As a would-be <br>intellectual, I found myself comfortably contemptuous of the middle <br>class (even though it was the class from which I happily derived), <br>its values and general style of living. As someone with declared <br>cultural interests, I tended to look down on businessmen, on <br>philistinism, on anyone, really, who thought there were more <br>important things in life than art and ideas. Other people might <br>achieve success in life &#x2014; I would seek significance.<br> Of course, for the most part I kept these snobbish notions to <br>myself. I believe &#x2014; at least I hope &#x2014; I never came across as <br>preposterous as I assuredly was in the inner drama I was then living. <br>Still, deep down (deep down, that is, for a shallow young person) I <br>tended to forgo the more innocent affectations by which people hope <br>to establish superiority &#x2014; through possessions, through memberships <br>in clubs and groups, through socially favorable marriages &#x2014; in favor <br>of a heavy freight of artiness and intellectuality.<br> This lasted for several years, certainly till my thirties. I <br>feel touches of it invade my thinking even today, when I sense my <br>superiority click in as some friend or relative expresses admiration <br>for a book or movie or play I think beneath seriousness. What is <br>operating here is the snobbery of opinion, or, more precisely, of <br>correct opinion. Someone tells me that he thinks, say, ...</p><h2>Action Research: Teachers as Researchers in the Classroom, Second Edition</h2><p><p><em><strong>Become part of an online action research community<br></strong></em>Craig Mertler has recently created a wiki for action research.&nbsp; <strong>Click here</strong> to become part of this online community and begin exchanging ideas, questions/answers, and reflections about action research today!<br><br>You can also follow Craig Mertler on Twitter @actionrsrchr, or listen to his podcasts <strong>here</strong>.<br><br><strong><em>Provides comprehensive coverage of action research methods without being unnecessarily technical</em></strong></p><p></p><p>The <b>Second Edition</b> of <b>Action Research: Teachers as Researchers in the Classroom</b> introduces practicing teachers to the process of conducting classroom-based action research.

President Thomas Jefferson keenly understood that the course of the nation&#39;s destiny lay westward and that a national &#34;Voyage of Discovery&#34; must be mounted to determine the nature and accessibility of the frontier. He commissioned his young secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead an intelligence-gathering expedition from the Missouri River to the northern Pacific coast and back. From 1804 to 1806, Lewis, accompanied by co-captain William Clark, the Shoshone guide Sacajawea, and thirty-two men, made the first trek across the Louisiana Purchase, mapping the rivers as he went, tracing the principal waterways to the sea, and establishing the American claim to the territories of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Together the captains kept a journal, a richly detailed record of the flora and fauna they sighted, the Indian tribes they encountered, and the awe-inspiring landscape they traversed, from their base camp near present-day St. Louis to the mouth of the Columbia River. In keeping this record they made an incomparable contribution to the literature of exploration and the writing of natural history.Bernard DeVoto (1897-1955), winner of the Pulitzer Prize, was a renowned scholar-historian of the American West and one of the country&#39;s greatest men of letters.</p><h2>Medical Terminology: A Programmed Learning Approach to the Language of Health Care</h2><p>This medical terminology text uses a Programmed Learning approach that is ideal for classroom use, self-paced study, or distance learning.

Emma Lou Morgan lives in a world of scorn and shame, not because her skin is black, but because it's <i>too</i> black. No one among her family, teachers, and friends has a word of consolation or hope for the despised and rejected girl. With nothing to lose, eighteen-year-old Emma Lou leaves her home in Idaho, seeking love and acceptance on a journey that ultimately leads her to the legendary community of the Harlem Renaissance.<br>A source of controversy upon its 1929 publication, <i>The Blacker the Berry</i> was the first novel to openly address color prejudice among black Americans. Author Wallace Thurman, an active member of the Harlem Renaissance, vividly recaptures the era's mood and spirit. His portrait of a young woman adrift in the city forms an enduringly relevant reflection of the search for racial, sexual, and cultural identity.</p><p><b>Wallace Thurman</b> is the author of <i>Harlem,</i> a play, and two other novels, <i>Infants of the Spring</i> and <i>Interne.</i> He died in 1934.<b>PART I</b> <p> <b>EMMA LOU</b> </p><p> More acutely than ever before Emma Lou began to feel that her luscious black complexion was somewhat of a liability, and that her marked color variation from the other people in her environment was a decided curse. Not that she minded being black, being a Negro necessitated having a colored skin, but she did mind being too black. She couldn't understand why such should be the case, couldn't comprehend the cruelty of the natal attenders who had allowed her to be dipped, as it were, in indigo ink when there were so many more pleasing colors on nature's palette. Biologically, it wasn't necessary either; her mother was quite fair, so was her mother's mother, and her mother's brother, and her mother's brother's son; but then none of them had had a black man for a father. Why <i>had</i> her mother married a black man? Surely there had been some eligible brown-skin men around. She didn't particularly desire to have had a "high yaller" father, but for her sake certainly some more happy medium could have been found. </p><p> She wasn't the only person who regretted her darkness either. It was an acquired family characteristic, this moaning and grieving over the color of her skin. Everything possible had been done to alleviate the unhappy condition, every suggested agent had been employed, but her skin, despite bleachings, scourgings, and powderings, had remained black -- fast black -- as nature had planned and effected. </p><p> She should have been a boy, then color of skin wouldn't have mattered so much, for wasn't her mother always saying that a black boy could get along, but that a black girl would never know anything but sorrow and disappointment? But she wasn't a boy; she was a girl, and color did matter, mattered so much that she would rather have missed receiving her high school diploma than have to sit as she now sat, the only odd and conspicuous figure on the auditorium platform of the Boise high school. Why had she allowed them to place her in the center of the first row, and why had they insisted upon her dressing entirely in white so that surrounded as she was by similarly attired pale-faced fellow graduates she resembled, not at all remotely, that comic picture her Uncle Joe had hung in his bedroom? The picture wherein the black, kinky head of a little red-lipped pickaninny lay like a fly in a pan of milk amid a white expanse of bedclothes. </p><p> But of course she couldn't have worn blue or black when the call was for the wearing of white, even if white was not complementary to her complexion. She would have been odd-looking anyway no matter what she wore and she would also have been conspicuous, for not only was she the only dark-skinned person on the platform, she was also the only Negro pupil in the entire school, and had been for the past four years. Well, thank goodness, the principal would soon be through with his monotonous farewell address, and she and the other members of her class would advance to the platform center as their names were called and receive the documents which would signify their unconditional release from public school. </p><p> As she thought of these things, Emma Lou glanced at those who sat to the right and to the left of her. She envied them their obvious elation, yet felt a strange sense of superiority because of her immunity for the moment from an ephemeral mob emotion. Get a diploma? -- What did it mean to her? College? -- Perhaps. A job? -- Perhaps again. She was going to have a high school diploma, but it would mean nothing to her whatsoever. The tragedy of her life was that she was too black. Her face and not a slender roll of ribbon-bound parchment was to be her future identification tag in society. High school diploma indeed! What she needed was an efficient bleaching agent, a magic cream that would remove this unwelcome black mask from her face and make her more like her fellow men. </p><p> "Emma Lou Morgan." </p><p> She came to with a start. The principal had called her name and stood smiling down at her benevolently. Some one -- she knew it was her Cousin Buddie, stupid imp -- applauded, very faintly, very provokingly. Some one else snickered. </p><p> "Emma Lou Morgan." </p><p> The principal had called her name again, more sharply than before and his smile was less benevolent. The girl who sat to the left of her nudged her. There was nothing else for her to do but to get out of that anchoring chair and march forward to receive her diploma. But why did the people in the audience have to stare so? Didn't they all know that Emma Lou Morgan was Boise high school's only nigger student? Didn't they all know -- but what was the use. She had to go get that diploma, so summoning her most insouciant manner, she advanced to the platform center, brought every muscle of her lithe limbs into play, haughtily extended her shiny black arm to receive the proffered diploma, bowed a chilly thanks, then holding her arms stiffly at her sides, insolently returned to her seat in that foreboding white line, insolently returned once more to splotch its pale purity and to mock it with her dark, outlandish difference. </p><p> Emma Lou had been born in a semi-white world, totally surrounded by an all-white one, and those few dark elements that had forced their way in had either been shooed away or else greeted with derisive laughter. It was the custom always of those with whom she came into most frequent contact to ridicule or revile any black person or object. A black cat was a harbinger of bad luck, black crepe was the insignia of mourning, and black people were either evil niggers with poisonous blue gums or else typical vaudeville darkies. It seemed as if the people in her world never went halfway in their recognition or reception of things black, for these things seemed always to call forth only the most extreme emotional reactions. They never provoked mere smiles or mere melancholy, rather they were the signal either for boisterous guffaws or pain-induced and tear-attended grief. </p><p> Emma Lou had been becoming increasingly aware of this for a long time, but her immature mind had never completely grasped its full, and to her tragic, significance. First there had been the case of her father, old black Jim Morgan they called him, and Emma Lou had often wondered why it was that he of all the people she heard discussed by her family should always be referred to as if his very blackness condemned him to receive no respect from his fellow men. </p><p> She had also begun to wonder if it was because of his blackness that he had never been in evidence as far as she knew. Inquiries netted very unsatisfactory answers. "Your father is no good." "He left your mother, deserted her shortly after you were born." And these statements were always prefixed or followed by some epithet such as "dirty black no-gooder" or "durn his onery black hide." There was in fact only one member of the family who did not speak of her father in this manner, and that was her Uncle Joe, who was also the only person in the family to whom she really felt akin, because he alone never seemed to regret, to bemoan, or to ridicule her blackness of skin. It was her grandmother who did all the regretting, her mother who did the bemoaning, her Cousin Buddie and her playmates, both white and colored, who did the ridiculing. </p><p> Emma Lou's maternal grandparents, Samuel and Maria Lightfoot, were both mulatto products of slave-day promiscuity between male masters and female chattel. Neither had been slaves, their own parents having been granted their freedom because of their close connections with the white branch of the family tree. These freedmen had migrated into Kansas with their children, and when these children had grown up they in turn had joined the westward-ho parade of that current era, and finally settled in Boise, Idaho. </p><p> Samuel and Maria, like many others of their kind and antecedents, had had only one compelling desire, which motivated their every activity and dictated their every thought. They wished to put as much physical and mental space between them and the former home of their parents as was possible. That was why they had left Kansas, for in Kansas there were too many reminders of that which their parents had escaped and from which they wished to flee. Kansas was too near the former slave belt, too accessible to disgruntled southerners, who, deprived of their slaves, were inculcated with an easily communicable virus, nigger hatred. Then, too, in Kansas all Negroes were considered as belonging to one class. It didn't matter if you and your parents had been freedmen before the Emancipation Proclamation, nor did it matter that you were almost three-quarters white. You were, nevertheless, classed with those hordes of hungry, ragged, ignorant black folk arriving from the South in such great numbers, packed like so many stampeding cattle in dirty, manure-littered box cars. </p><p> From all of this these maternal grandparents of Emma Lou fled, fled to the Rocky Mountain states which were too far away for the recently freed slaves to reach, especially since most of them believed that the world ended just a few miles north of the Mason-Dixon line. Then, too, not only were the Rocky Mountain states beyond the reach of this raucous and smelly rabble of recently freed cotton pickers and plantation hands, but they were also peopled by pioneers, sturdy land and gold seekers from the East, marching westward, always westward in search of El Dorado, and being too busy in this respect to be violently aroused by problems of race unless economic factors precipitated matters. </p><p> So Samuel and Maria went into the fast farness of a little known Rocky Mountain territory and settled in Boise, at the time nothing more than a trading station for the Indians and whites, and a red light center for the cowboys and sheepherders and miners in the neighboring vicinity. Samuel went into the saloon business and grew prosperous. Maria raised a family and began to mother nuclear elements for a future select Negro social group. </p><p> There was of course in such a small and haphazardly populated community some social intermixture between whites and blacks. White and black ga...</p></p><h2>Live Oak, with Moss</h2><p>As he was turning forty, Walt Whitman wrote twelve poems in a small handmade book he entitled &#x201c;Live Oak, With Moss.&#x201d; The poems were intensely private reflections on his attraction to and affection for other men.

Students are shown, rather than told about, how physics works and are given the opportunity to apply concepts to real-world problems. Each chapter and concept has been scrutinized to ensure clarity, currency, and accuracy while checkpoints, problem solving tactics, and sample problems help students make sense of new concepts. As always, Fundamentals of Physics covers every aspect of basic physics, from force and motion to relativity and will prepare today&#39;s students to be tomorrow&#39;s scientists.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Probabilistic Revolution: Ideas in the Sciences</h2><p>This monumental work traces the rise, the transformation, and the diffusion of probabilistic and statistical thinking in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.</p><p>Lorenz Kr�ger is a philosopher of science at G�ttingen University.<p>I can think of no other comparable work that comes even close to covering the same important material in the history of science and philosophy.</p> (Patrick Suppes, Stanford University)<br><br><p>These two volumes come close to the best that can be achieved on the topics and the period covered.

In this classic underground text, queer theorist and post-'68 provocateur Guy Hocquenghem takes on the militant delusions of the gay liberation movement. Hocquenghem, founder and leader of the Front Homosexuel d'Action Revolutionnaire, vivisects not only the stifled mores of bourgeois capitalism but the phallocratic concessions of so-called homophiles, and, ultimately, the very act of speaking desire (and non-desire). Rejecting any &#x201c;pure theory&#x201d; of homosexuality that claims its &#x201c;otherness&#x201d; as a morphology of revolution, he contends that the ruling classes have invented homosexuality as a sexual ghetto, splitting and mutilating desire in the process. It is only when non-desire and the desire of desire are enacted simultaneously through speech and body that homosexuality can finally be sublimated under the true act of &#x201c;making love.&#x201d; There are thousands of sexes on earth, according to Hocquenghem, but only one sexual desire.

Born in the early 1600s when artists were the celebrities of the day, Artemisia was apprenticed to her father, the artist Orazio Gentileschi, at an early age. Raped by his partner Agostino Tassi at seventeen, the Gentileschi name was dragged through scandal for Artemisia refused, even when tortured, to deny that she had been raped. Indeed, she went farther: she dared to plead her case in court. Artemisia is the story of a powerful love/hate relationship between master and pupil, father and daughter, and a talent that overturned the prejudices of the day, winning commissions from wealthy patrons, nobles, and kings. Lapierre brings Artemisia Gentileschi to vivid life as she tells of the emotional struggles of the most fascinating and controversial artist of her time.</p><p>Small wonder that biographer Alexandra Lapierre was drawn to write about Artemisia Gentileschi, one of the first female painters to gain acclaim in the male-dominated 17th-century art world. Her story has all the ingredients of high drama: rape, jealousy, and an infamous court trial set against a backdrop of art and passion. Meticulously researched, framed in a fictional context, Lapierre's treatment applies a painterly touch to a scholarly work. Billed as a biography in the U.K. but as a novel in the U.S., it combines the rigor of one genre with the page-turning immediacy of the other.<p> Born in Rome to the artist Orazio Gentileschi and his wife Prudenzia, Artemisia's life was turned upside down after the death of her mother. Orazio jealously guarded his only daughter, refusing her outside contact even as he taught her the subtleties of painting. At 17, Artemisia, already a skilled artist, was facing a life of spinsterhood as her father's prisoner. Yet the Gentileschi household was full of the comings and goings of artists whose shifting allegiances were as complex as the politics of the time. When Orazio's friend, arrogant trompe l'oeil master Agostino Tassi, set his sights on young Artemisia, her refusals only stoked his passion. What followed was rape. Tassi kept her quiet through promises of marriage; when marriage was not forthcoming, Tassi found himself in court.</p><p> Even under torture, Artemisia's statement never wavered, and eventually Tassi was convicted. The mild sentence scarcely harmed him, yet the experience had a lasting effect on his victim. Touched by scandal, Artemisia was able to marry an inferior painter only by virtue of a substantial dowry. Through an unhappy marriage, the deaths of her first children, and the lives of her daughters, however, she continued to paint, eventually gaining considerable acclaim. Interestingly enough, given her experiences, her paintings of religious allegory often portrayed women in illustrations of strength and dominance. If her depiction of Judith violently decapitating Holofernes elicited the Grand Duchess's repulsion, the Grand Duke Cosimo II was riveted. Others in the room saw the allusion to the artist's own past: "'This face, so close to death, brings someone to mind,' the secretary, Andrea Cioli, interjected insidiously. 'A painter, your Highness...'" </p><p> <i>Artemisia</i> blends storytelling and careful detail in a complex rendering that will particularly appeal to readers with an interest in either Baroque art or Italian history. Color plates illustrate the haunting quality of Artemisia's work, and the end notes make clear which portions derive from documentation and which are fictional strokes of color. The uninitiated may have a difficult time unraveling the intricacies of characters and politics, perhaps because Lapierre is more at home with scholarship than with fiction. Worse, her breathless prose sometimes tries too hard, even while doing little to reveal her characters' inner worlds. In the end, it's both the compelling quality of Artemisia's story and the lushness of Lapierre's supporting detail that hold this unusual book together. <i>--Anne DeGrace</i></p>In this heroic, passionate story, Alexandra Lapierre sweeps her audience through the streets once frequented by Caravaggio, Velasquez, and Van Dyck and the studios of the artists who used their daggers as efficiently as their brushes. <p>Born to the artist Orazio Gentileschi at the beginning of the 1600s, when artists were the celebrities of their day, Artemisia was apprenticed to her father at an early age. She showed such remarkable talent that he came to view her as the most precious thing he owned. But at the age of seventeen Artemisia was raped by her father's best friend and partner, Agostini Tassi. Soon the Gentileschi name was being dragged through scandal, for Artemisia refused, even when tortured, to deny that she had been raped. Indeed, she went farther: she dared to plead her case in court. For eight months all of Rome was riveted by the trial. Artemisia won the case, but in return she was ostracized from Rome and from her father. </p><p>This is a story of the love-hate relationship between master and pupil, father and daughter, at a time when daughters belonged to their fathers and had no legal rights. Artemisia's talent was such that she overturned the prejudices of her time, winning the admiration of wealthy patrons, kings, and queens. Lapierre brings Artemisia Gentileschi to vivid life as she tells of the emotional struggle of this remarkable, fascinating woman. </p><p>"This is one of the most vivid biographies ever written about an artist. It is also a lively portrait of Rome during the epoque of the Cenci and Caravaggio, and of Venice and Naples and London in the throes of Baroque excess. Above all, Artemisia is a fascinating, if often frightening, study of the relationship of a brilliant father and daughter and their tortured but endlessly colorful lives."--Nicholas Fox Weber, author of Balthus: A Biography </p><p>"A book bristling with adventure, noise, passion and color which re-creates Baroque Italy in all its diversity, from the ballrooms to the torture chambers, from trials to marriages, from drinking parties to underground conspiracies."--Les Echos </p><p>"Alexandra Lapierre's heroines live passionately and wildly.... This book is simply wonderful."--Le Figaro </p><p>"Artemisia is cut from the marble of masterpieces."--Beaux Arts </p><p>"[Lapierre] has more than achieved the challenge she set for herself and given us a magnificent portrait of a painter and the world in which she moved."--Cesare de Seta, Corriere della Serra </p><p>"This wonderfully researched...full of interest and intrigue. It is not art criticism but it does deal with questions of greatness and gender.... A book worth reading."--Jeanette Winterson, The Times (London) </p><p>Alexandra Lapierre's most recent book, Fanny Stevenson: A Romance of Destiny was awarded the highly regarded Elle magazine literary prize in 1993.</p></p><h2>The Man Who Beats the S&amp;P: Investing with Bill Miller</h2><p>Learn value investing through the strategies and techniques of the Investment Portfolio Manager of the decade<br>In the only value investing book focused on value investor Bill Miller, the manager of the $11.6 billion Legg Mason Value Trust, Janet Lowe examines the techniques that have earned Miller celebrity status among investors and his peers.

Within this framework, Cuban explored how major school reform efforts to alter classroom teaching often resulted in modest shifts in pedagogy in elementary schools and even less change in secondary schools.</p><p>Now, in this second edition, <em>How Teachers Taught: Constancy and Change in American Classrooms, 1890&#x2013;1990</em>, Larry Cuban returns to his pioneering inquiry into the history of teaching practice in the United States, responds to criticisms, and incorporates the scholarship of the last ten years. While not abandoning his basic thesis of the remarkable continuity in teacher-based instruction, Cuban now examines more closely the phenomenon of &#x201c;hybrids&#x201d; of student-centered and teacher-centered pedagogy, and finds many instances of classroom change sufficient to give pause to those who see futility in classroom reform. The author looks closely at socioeconomic contexts and the evolution of curriculum content. In the final chapter, Cuban directly assesses the implications of his work for policymakers, practitioners, and researchers. Historians, sociologists, and educators will also find powerful relevancy to their work, and the general reader will join in an exciting search for historical realities.</p></p><p><p><br> &#x201c;There are no bumper-sticker solutions to educational problems here, no election year gimmicks.

Set on a vast ringworld encircling a sun, Macbeth and his wife, Lady Macbeth, scheme and plot their way to power, only to be undone by their own deadly plans. Artist Tony Tamai&#x2019;s unique vision and style breathe new life into a captivating classic.</p><p>William Shakespeare (April 1564 - April 23, 1616) was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, and his birth is traditionally celebrated on April 23. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019; s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including&nbsp;<i>Sir Thomas More</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including&nbsp;<i>Venus and Adonis</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as&nbsp;<b>The Tempest</b>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<b>Henry VII</b>&nbsp;until about 1613. He died on April 23 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.Grade 9 Up&#x2013;In this adaptation, the Weird Sisters are cloaked robots that speak in barcode, the soldiers horses are winged dragonlike creatures, and the letters to Lady Macbeth arrive via computer. Despite the intriguing potential of this format and the updated setting, the book is disappointing. As the story opens, the black-and-white artwork is intricate and appealing. However, readers unfamiliar with the plot will have difficulty following the action and the characters. Also, the quality of the illustrations tends to deteriorate at random intervals. For example, in some scenes Lady Macbeth is harshly outlined with thick black lines that look like the work of an amateur manga artist, while in the same panel her husband appears masterfully drawn. Similarly, halfway through the murder of Lady Macduff, the style shifts abruptly, disrupting the flow of the panels. This science-fiction version of the play might be fun to use in a classroom to illustrate the timelessness of the Bards plays, but it is unlikely to find a wide audience.&#x2013;<i>Heather M.

Falsely accused of trying to murder Phoebus, who attempts to rape her, Esmeralda is sentenced to death and rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo who defends her to the last.<br><br>The subject of many adaptations for stage and screen, this remains perhaps one of the most romantic yet gripping stories ever told.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>The Hunchback of Notre-Dame </i>is an epic of a whole people, with a cast of characters that ranges from the king of France to the beggars who inhabit the Parisian sewers, and at their center the massive figure--a character in itself--of the great Cathedral of Notre-Dame. Quasimodo, the deformed bell-ringer of the cathedral; his foster father, the tormented archdeacon Frollo; and the beautiful and doomed Gypsy Esmeralda are caught up in a tragedy that still speaks clearly to us of revolution and social strife, of destiny and free will, and of love and loss. <br><br>The only widely available hardcover edition of Victor Hugo's masterful historical novel of medieval Paris--one of the most beloved of world classics.</p><p>Designed for school districts, educators, and students seeking to maximize performance on standardized tests, Webster&#x2019;s paperbacks take advantage of the fact that classics are frequently assigned readings in English courses.

It has tempted filmmakers, and most recently animators, who have exploited its dramatic content to good effect but have inevitably lost some of the grays that make the original text so compelling.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; From Victor Hugo's flamboyant imagination came Quasimodo, the grotesque bell ringer; La Esmeralda, the sensuous gypsy dancer; and the haunted archdeacon Claude Frollo. Hugo set his epic tale in the Paris of 1482 under Louis XI and meticulously re-created the <br>day-to-day life of its highest and lowest inhabitants. Written at a time of perennial political upheaval in France, The Hunchback of Notre-Dame&nbsp;&nbsp;is the product of an emerging democratic sensibility and prefigures the teeming masterpiece Les Mis�rables, which Hugo would write thirty years later.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; He made the cathedral the centerpiece of the novel and called it Notre-Dame de Paris. (It received its popular English title at the time of its second translation in 1833.) Hugo wrote that his inspiration came from a carving of the word "fatality" in Greek that he had found in the cathedral. The inscription had been eradicated by the time the book was published, and Hugo feared that Notre-Dame's Gothic splendor might soon be lost to the contemporary fad for tearing down old buildings. Notre-Dame has survived as one of the great monuments of Paris, and Hugo's novel is a fitting celebration of it, a popular classic that is proving to be just as enduring.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

The mathematical integrity of the previous edition has been maintained in the new edition. The core topics and their applications are presented in Parts One and Two of this text, and additional applications are developed in Part Three. Parts One and Two are independent of one another, thus either probability or linear mathematics may be studied first. The authors&#39; emphasis is on developing and testing the student&#39;s problem-solving ability. They use discussions and examples to illustrate ideas and techniques to aid the student in acquiring these skills. Some examples and exercises are straightforward computation, while others require that the problem be solved by combining several techniques. Since it is impossible to provide examples of every type of problem the student will encounter in the text, the authors have identified and treated the fundamental principles that should be used in unfamiliar situations.</p><p>Maynard Thompson has research interests in the applications of mathematics to problems arising in biology and medicine.

From the sun and wind? From fuel and heat?</p><p>You get energy every time you eat. You transfer energy to other things every time you play baseball. In this book, you can find out all the ways you and everyone on earth need energy to make things happen.</p></p><p><p>Kimberly Brubaker Bradley is the author of <strong>Energy Makes Things Happen</strong> and <strong>Pop!</strong>, an Outstanding Science Trade Book for Children, in the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science series. She has a degree in chemistry from Smith College and lives with her husband and two children in Bristol, Tennessee.</p><br><br><p>Paul Meisel has illustrated many books for children, including <em>Why Are the Ice Caps Melting?</em>, <em>Energy Makes Things Happen</em>, and <em>What Happens to Our Trash?</em> in the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science series. He lives in Newtown, Connecticut.</p>Grade 1-3-This worthy title uses familiar examples and a clear focus to introduce basic scientific concepts. An opening scene shows children playing ball, flying kites, and cooking and eating hot dogs, with a rock on a hill in the background. Bradley explains that inherent in the scenarios are different kinds of energy. She then tells how the kite uses the wind, the rock converts stored energy into moving energy, and so on, and discusses how the greatest source of power, the sun, makes food, fossil fuels, light, heat, and wind. The author intentionally makes this a very general introduction; not even moderately difficult words such as "potential" or "kinetic" are used. A simple experiment and a game are appended. While rolling a toy car into a stationary one and observing the result can be easily done, tracing energy back to the sun will probably need adult guidance. Meisel's color illustrations of cheerful multiethnic children match the level and tone of the text perfectly, make it more comprehensible, and add to the book's appeal. While educational theorists believe that children can't grasp abstractions until at least age seven, younger readers will gain some familiarity with the concept even if they don't really understand it. Larry White's Energy: Simple Experiments for Young Scientists (Millbrook, 1995) offers a more sophisticated and detailed introduction, along with many experiments, for older readers, but Bradley's title is a good first exposure to the subject.<br><i>Louise L.

Wilson, V. S. Apte and L. R. Vaidya, but their bulkiness and cost prohibit a large number of users from enjoying an advantage so necessary in their study of Sanskrit. There is, therefore, a crying need for one which supplies everything required by an average reader and which is at the same time characterized by brevity and cheapness. The present compilation is intended to serve this purpose. The author in this handy work has kept out Sanskrit words which are less commonly used and has tried to avoid all technicalities as well as words which can easily be seen as simple derivatives of some given words.

Saxton's thesis--that white racism was strategic to do you mean `in the interest'? `a concern'?aa both the ruling and working classes and was reinforced by the media and literature--is supported by his analysis of Jacksonian democracy, which promoted the removal of Indians from Western lands and the continuance of slavery as a means of achieving equality among whites.

Costs associated with falls among the elderly are estimated to range from $75 billion to $100 billion. Coupling this statistic with the fact that adults over the age of 65 represent the fastest-growing population in the United States suggests an immediate need for activity programs specifically designed to reduce physical frailty and the rising incidence of falls among the older adult population. <i>FallProof!: A Comprehensive Balance and Mobility Training Program</i> is the first comprehensive and structured balance and mobility training program to address these needs. </p><p>Traditionally, exercise programs designed to address physical frailty and falls have adopted one-dimensional approaches of aerobic exercise, resistance training, or flexibility training. However, research has shown that falls occur as a result of multiple risk factors, both internal and external, and the interplay of multiple body systems. <i>FallProof!</i> presents a multidimensional approach that systematically manipulates the individual's internal capabilities, the goals of the task being performed, and the environment in which the task is performed. This approach has been field tested with considerable success by fitness instructors and rehabilitative specialists working in a range of instructional settings.</p><p><i>FallProof!</i> offers the following benefits:</p><p>-<b>Flexibility.</b> Program participants can engage in group activities that take into account their individual abilities so that the program is not too easy or too difficult for them.</p><p>-<b>Guidance.</b> <i>FallProof!</i> illustrates the easiest and safest ways to present each of the program's exercise components, addressing issues from safety concerns to the best ways to offer feedback to participants. </p><p>-<b>Supplemental materials.</b> Reproducible health, assessment, and safety questionnaires help program instructors gather crucial information and save time and energy.</p><p>-<b>Results.</b> The <i>FallProof!</i> program has been proven to reduce the risk of falling in participants who've completed one or more rotations of the program.<br><i>FallProof!</i> is divided into three parts. <b>Part I</b> provides an introduction to the body systems that contribute to balance and mobility and common age-related changes occurring in each of these systems. It also identifies the multifactorial causes of falls and describes the common medical conditions (arthritis, joint replacement surgery, osteoporosis, Parkinson's disease, and diabetes) and medications known to adversely affect balance and mobility. <b>Part II</b> provides suggestions on balance assessments and details the core program. And finally, <b>Part III</b> describes how to incorporate contemporary motor learning principles to foster optimal learning, develop lesson plans, organize the classroom environment for optimal safety and efficiency, and communicate with program participants.</p><p><i>FallProof!</i> is a practical manual that blends the latest theory into practical applications.

In lively, colorful prose,<i> Rubble</i> rides the wrecking ball through key episodes in the world of demolition. Stretching over more than five hundred years of razing and toppling, this story looks back to London&#x2019;s Great Fire of 1666, where self-deputized wreckers artfully blew houses apart with barrels of gunpowder to halt the furious blaze, and spotlights the advent of dynamite&#x2014;courtesy of demolition&#x2019;s patron saint, Alfred Nobel&#x2014;that would later fuel epochal feats of unbuilding such as the implosion of the infamous Pruitt-Igoe housing complex in St. Louis.<br><br><i>Rubble </i>also delves beyond these bravura blasts to survey the world-jarring invention of the wrecking ball; the oddly stirring ruin of New York&#x2019;s old Pennsylvania Station, that potent symbol of the wrecker run amok; and the ever busy bulldozers in places as diverse as Detroit, Berlin, and the British countryside. Rich with stories of demolition&#x2019;s quirky impresarios&#x2014;including Mark Loizeaux, the world-famous engineer of destruction who brought Seattle&#x2019;s Kingdome to the ground in mere seconds&#x2014;this account makes first-hand forays to implosion sites and digs extensively into wrecking&#x2019;s little-known historical record.<br><br><i>Rubble</i> is also an exploration of what happens when buildings fall, when monuments topple into memory, and when &#x201c;destructive creativity&#x201d; tears down to build again. It unearths the world of demolition for the first time and, along the way, throws a penetrating light on the role that destruction must play in our lives as a necessary prelude to renewal. Told with arresting detail and energy, this tale goes to the heart of the scientific, social, economic, and personal meaning of how we unbuild our world.<br><br><i>Rubble </i>is the first-ever biography of the wrecking trade, a riveting, character-filled narrative of how the black art of demolition grew to become a multibillion-dollar business, an extreme spectator sport, and a touchstone for what we value, what we disdain, who we were, and what we wish to become.</p><p>Jeff Byles has written feature articles and critical reviews about architecture, urbanism, and culture for the <i>New York Times</i>, the<i> Village Voice</i>, <i>Metropolis, NY Arts</i>, and other publications. He lives in New York City.The controlled reduction of buildings to rubble is "the black art of our time," writes Byles. In this colorful thematic history of the demolition trade (a subject he was pursuing, it should be said, before the destruction of the Twin Towers), he rightfully calls Alfred Nobel, the inventor of dynamite, "the patron saint of creative destruction." Only in the 1910s did the simple need to topple skyscrapers emerge as a fact of urban renewal. Before 1900, demolition was only sporadically used to prevent the spread of fire, and was largely an inefficient matter of pulling buildings down, not exploding or imploding them. Over time, the dangers of wrecking balls led to an increased emphasis on hydraulics and contained explosives. Today, the ostentatious annihilation of gargantuan stadia and casinos draws awestruck throngs. Byles examines this history, looking at the "clear-cutting of entire neighborhoods" in Paris by Baron Haussmann ("who called himself 'artist-demolitionist' "), the "sorry end" of New York's original, monumental Pennsylvania Station (and its impact on the urban preservation movement) and the destruction of the Dunes Hotel in Las Vegas. With brio, Byles ably and pungently excavates the shadowy crannies of this underappreciated art, summarized by one practitioner as "a little dynamite, judiciously placed." 25 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

There, his work as a freelance illustrator for The Daily News included sketching historic buildings throughout the city. After 10 years at Disney Feature Animation Studios, he continues to pursue his passion through sketching and teaching."There's a chapter on choosing a sketchbook, and a chapter on pencils and pens and paintbrushes, there are chapters on technique for lighting, for drawing heads and hands and feet, all the requisite chapters for a how-to-draw book. What makes this book so useful are the chapters on more nebulous concepts, like how to choose a subject, or what to do when people notice you drawing. What Chapman's book does that makes it so helpful is that, instead of saying, "One day you might be able to do this, and maybe people will take you seriously," Chapman makes you, the artist, feel like a confident member of an envied community. She notes that almost everyone wishes they could draw, so the very idea that you're doing it at all makes you seem incredible."<br>--<i>San Francisco Book Review, www.sanfranciscobookreview.com</i><br><br>"An exceptional selection for intermediate and advanced artists looking to step out of the studio."<br>--<i>Library Journal</i></p><h2>School Zone - Big First Grade Workbook - 320 Pages, Ages 6 to 7, 1st Grade, Beginning Reading, Phonics, Spelling, Basic Math, Word Problems, Time, Money, and More (School Zone Big Workbook Series)</h2><p><p>Find our complete line of educational resources at Amazon.com/SchoolZonePublishing.</p> <p><b>BOOK FEATURES</b></p> <ul> <li>320 pages: 302 activity pages, 18 answer key pages</li> <li>For ages 6 to 7</li> <li>7.75" x 10.75" pages with durable glossy cover</li> <li>Book has multiple sections with Parent notes for each: Time, Money &amp; Fractions, Phonics &amp; Spelling, Basic Math, Reading Comprehension, Vocabulary</li> <li>Colorful, kid friendly illustrations reinforce the lessons</li> <li>Easy directions and visual clues promote self-directed learning</li> <li>Perforated pages are easy to tear out for individual worksheets</li></ul><p><b> AMAZING</b> - Big First Grade Workbook has 300+ colorful exercises that make learning fun!

And she knew that teachers didn&#x2019;t have the time to give her kids everything they needed. As an elementary school teacher, Hoffman worked hard to give her students what they needed to learn. And parents would ask her what they could do to help. That&#x2019;s why she started School Zone&#x2014;to help give children every possible chance to reach their potential.&nbsp;</p> <p>She brought retail experience gleaned from previously founding and managing two regional educational book and supply stores for teachers and parents.

He also started the Big Spelling 1-3 book about 4 months ago and has less than 100 pages to go out of 320 pages.

Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. A very private woman, she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or personal life. Her work included Regency romances, mysteries and historical fiction.

She lives in New York and writes for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, Food &amp; Wine, Eating Well, Cook's Illustrated, Vegetarian Times, and Natural Health.Veteran vegetarian cookbook author Lorna Sass (The New Soy Cookbook) offers 40 healthy vegan recipes, international in inspiration. Rich vegetable-based broths, nuts and nut butters, as well as Asian and Indian spices, add luxurious texture and flavor to these vegan dishes making a diet free of animal products (as well as the unhealthy fats and cholesterols they contain) seem easy. Practical information on stocking a vegan pantry, designing vegan menus and mail-order sources for high-quality ingredients will appeal to novices, while new cooking techniques such as slow-baking beans and whole-grain cooking will appeal to more experienced vegan cooks. Hiziki Tapenade is particularly delightful, the Japanese sea vegetable hiziki substituting for anchovies in this traditional Proven&#x2021;al spread. Simple vegetable sides are enhanced by adding brewer's yeast (more tasty than it sounds) or slow roasting, as in the sophisticated Slow-Roasted Tomatoes and Fennel, served with a drizzle of olive oil and garnished with balsamic syrup. While Sass's desserts, such as chocolate rice pudding, are lovely codas to a vegan feast, no one would confuse them with "real" i.e., cream and egg desserts. (Of course, if they do lack the decadent flavor and richness of your favorite pies and ice creams, they also lack the saturated fat and extra calories.) This book is essential for vegans and those who cook for them. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Lies: A Diary 1986-1999</h2><p>The Pulitzer Prize-winning composer, author, and president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters shares his diary of the years between sixty-two and seventy-five years of age. 10,000 first printing.</p><p>For 40 years, the diaries of Ned Rorem have been ideal bedtime reading for musicians. This first installment of the new century, covering 1986 to 1999, parades a few of Rorem's familiar themes: insomnia, self-contradictions, letters to the editor (some never sent, some never published), and, of course, notes on his own music (including an especially lovely commentary on the English Horn Concerto). There are some unexpected anecdotes as well, including one about dinner with Nancy Reagan, an appreciation of Frank O'Hara, and the chronicle of a long-running dispute with neighbor Itzhak Perlman's air conditioner (the air conditioner wins). Rorem appraises new music, slamming Boulez, Schnittke, and Bruce Springsteen (who share good company with Beethoven and Mother Teresa), but there is a sudden about-face on Rorem's former b�te noire, Elliott Carter. This time, however, the tone is darker than before because death is all around. Rorem's parents, in separate wings of a nursing home, die within months of each other. And above all, the diary covers the long decline and death of partner Jim Holmes, who suffers from Crohn's disease, cancer, and HIV (he withholds his discovery that he's been carrying the virus from Rorem for several months).<p> The final third of the diary, when Holmes's pills alone are described as costing $15,000 a year, is achingly sad, but somehow, Rorem avers, "the purpose of a diary is to evade real life." He thinks that "nobody sings my songs anymore," so it is to be hoped that he was heartened by Susan Graham's sensational Rorem anthology released in 2000, as well as his 2001 Grammy nomination for "best contemporary classical composition" for the song cycle <i>Evidence of Things Not Seen</i>. Rorem's prose, as ever, is delightful and instantly recognizable as his alone: "there never <i>was</i> a Great Man in America, except maybe Martha Graham." <i>--William R. Braun</i></p>Since 1966 and the publication of The Paris Diary, Ned Rorem has led a dual career as a composer and a writer. Time magazine has called him &#34;the world&#39;s best composer of art songs,&#34; and Joyce Carol Oates has said that &#34;his prose is as fresh and unfailingly interesting as his music.&#34; His five volumes of diaries, together with his memoir Knowing When to Stop, are a unique contribution to the art of autobiography and to America&#39;s cultural and social history; his many collections of essays on music have won him three ASCAP-Deems Taylor Awards. The current president of the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Ned Rorem divides his time between Manhattan and Nantucket.</p><h2>The Cambridge Companion to Joseph Conrad (Cambridge Companions to Literature)</h2><p>The Cambridge Companion to Joseph Conrad offers a wide-ranging introduction to the fiction of Joseph Conrad, one of the most influential novelists of the twentieth century. Leading Conrad scholars give an account of Conrad&#39;s life, provide detailed readings of his major works, and discuss his narrative techniques, his complex relationship with cultural developments of his time, his influence on later writers and artists, and recent developments in Conrad criticism. The volume, which is aimed at students and the general reader, also contains a chronology and guide to further reading.</p><p>Leading Conrad scholars provide an account of Conrad&#39;s life and detailed readings of his major works.

Deeply influential and wonderfully productive, he is remembered for dozens of masterworks, from <i>The Firebird</i> and <i>The Rite of Spring</i> to <i>The Rake's Progress,</i> but no dependable biography of him exists. Previous studies have relied too heavily on his own unreliable memoirs and conversations, and until now no biographer has possessed both the musical knowledge to evaluate his art and the linguistic proficiency needed to explore the documentary background of his life--a life whose span extended from tsarist Russia to Switzerland, France, and ultimately the United States.<br><br>In this revealing volume, the first of two, Stephen Walsh follows Stravinsky from his birth in 1882 to 1934. He traces the composer's early Russian years in new and fascinating detail, laying bare the complicated relationships within his family and showing how he first displayed his extraordinary talents within the provincial musical circle around his teacher, Nikolay Rimsky-Korsakov. Stravinsky's brilliantly creative involvement with the Ballets Russes is illuminated by a sharp sense of the internal artistic politics that animated the group. Portraying Stravinsky's circumstances as an �migr� in France trying to make his living as a conductor and pianist as well as a composer while beset by emotional and financial demands, Walsh reveals the true roots of his notorious obsession with money during the 1920s and describes with sympathy the nature of his long affair with Vera Sudeykina.<br><br>While always respecting Stravinsky's own insistence that life and art be kept distinct, Stravinsky makes clear precisely how the development of his music was connected to his life and to the intellectual environment in which he found himself. But at the same time it demonstrates the composer's&nbsp;&nbsp;remarkably pragmatic psychology, which led him to consider the welfare of his art to be of paramount importance, before which everything else had to give way. Hence, for example, his questionable attitude toward Hitler and Mussolini, and his reputation as a touchy, unpredictable man as famous for his enmities as for his friendships.<br><br>Stephen Walsh, long established as an expert on Stravinsky's music, has drawn upon a vast array of material, much of it unpublished or unavailable in English, to bring the man himself, in all his color and genius, to glowing life. Written with elegance and energy, comprehensive, balanced, and original, Stravinsky is essential reading for anyone interested in the adventure of art in our time.<br><br>Praise from the British press for Stephen Walsh's <b> The Music of Stravinsky </b><br><br>"One of the finest general studies of the composer."<br>--Wilfrid Mellers, composer, <i>Times Literary Supplement</i><br><br>"The beautiful prose of <b>The Music of Stravinsky</b> is itself a fund of arresting images. For those who already love Stravinsky's music, Walsh's essays on each work will bring a smile of recognition and joy at new kernels of insight. For those unfamiliar with many of the works he discusses, Walsh's commentaries are likely to whet appetites for performances of the works."<br>--John Shepherd, <i>Notes</i><br><br>"This book sent me scurrying back to the scores and made me want to recommend it to other people. Above all, it is a good read."<br>--Anthony Pople, <i>Music and Letters</i></p><p>Already noted for a book on his subject's art (<i>The Music of Stravinsky</i>), Stephen Walsh is equally illuminating about Igor Stravinsky's turbulent life. This first installment of a projected two-volume work covers the years 1882 to 1934, during which time Walsh shows the composer creating many of his famous works, most notably <i>The Rite of Spring</i>, whose riotous 1913 premiere announced the arrival of a boldly modern classical music. He follows Stravinsky from his native Russia to Switzerland and France, as well as a 10-week tour of America in 1925. Delving into Russian-language documents seldom consulted by Western scholars, Walsh corrects many factual errors and, more importantly, makes evident the importance of Stravinsky's Russian roots and musical training, which the composer himself often downplayed in later years in order to "cultivate the image of the 'synthetic' international master." He's similarly judicious in evaluating Stravinsky's stormy 20-year association with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes and his seldom-adept juggling of a long-suffering wife and a more sophisticated mistress. Candid about his distaste for some of Stravinsky's behavior and character traits, Walsh never seems nasty: "It is the richest personalities," he reminds us, "who engage us most fully." <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Stephen Walsh is a critic and musicologist who has written extensively on Stravinsky and other modern composers.

In this series of essays, photographer and teacher Guy Tal shares his thoughts and experiences as an artist who seeks to express more in his images than the mere appearance of the subject portrayed. <br><br> Tal makes an argument to consider creative landscape photography&#x2015;expressing something of the photographer's conception through the use of natural aesthetics&#x2015;as a form of visual art that is distinct from the mere representation of beautiful natural scenes.<br><br> Tal covers topics such as the art of photography, approaches to landscape photography, and the experiences of a working photographic artist. His essays also include reflections on nature and man&#x2019;s place in it, living a meaningful life, and living as an artist in today&#x2019;s world. <br><br> The book is decidedly non-technical and focuses on philosophy, nature, and visual expression. It was written for those photographers with a passion and interest in creative photography. Anyone who is pursuing their work as art, is in need of inspiration, or is interested in the writings of a full-time working photographic artist will benefit from reading this book. The book is visually punctuated with Tal&#x2019;s inspiring and breathtaking photography.<br><br> <i>&#x201c;Some images look like things, while others feel like things; some images are of things, while others are about things. ...A creative image is not a record of a scene nor a substitute for a real experience. Rather, it is an experience in itself&#x2015;an aesthetic experience&#x2015;something new that the artist has given the world, rather than a contrived view of something that already existed independent of them.&#x201d; </i>~Guy Tal<br><br> **** <i>Guy Tal&#x2019;s photography is thoughtful, compassionate, and poetic; it&#x2019;s no wonder then that his writings evoke similar feelings in me. If you want to be a better camera user, read your manual. If you want to be a stronger, deeper photographer, read Guy Tal.</i> ~David duChemin</p><p>As a professional artist and writer, Guy Tal believes the practice of creative pursuits not only manifests in the making of art, but also has the ability to enrich life, foster meaningful experiences and contentment, and bring healing through life-long discovery and adventure. Tal strives to create images that convey his connection with the wild places of the American West. His images are a result of his complex relationship with these lands that has evolved over many years&#x2015;through times of bliss and conflict, love and loss, and life changes. In his images, he seeks to convey a reverence and gratitude for how these places have shaped his life. His subjects are not just attractive models to him, they are friends and sanctuaries and characters in his own story. He does not consider himself a photographer who creates art, but rather an artist working in the medium of photography. Tal's work has been featured in various publications, including LensWork Magazine, PHOTOGRAPH, Outdoor Photographer, Popular Photography, Digital Photographer, Landscape Photography Magazine, PhotoLife, and On Landscape, among others.

In this moving and thought-provoking volume, Arthur Kleinman tells the unsettling stories of a handful of men and women, some of whom have lived through some of the most fundamental transitions of the turbulent twentieth century.<br> Here we meet an American veteran of World War II, tortured by the memory of the atrocities he committed while a soldier in the Pacific. A French-American woman aiding refugees in sub-Saharan Africa, facing the utter chaos of a society where life has become meaningless. A Chinese doctor trying to stay alive during Mao's cultural revolution, discovering that the only values that matter are those that get you beyond the next threat. These individuals have found themselves caught in circumstances where those things that matter most to them--their desires, status, relationships, resources, political and religious commitments, life itself--have been challenged by the society around them. Each is caught up in existential moral experiences that define what it means to be human, with an intensity that makes their life narratives arresting. Their stories reveal just how malleable moral life is, and just how central danger is to our worlds and our livelihood. Indeed, Kleinman offers in this book a groundbreaking approach to ethics, examining "who we are" through some of the most disturbing issues of our time--war, globalization, poverty, social injustice, sex, and religion--all in the context of actual lived moral life.<br> Here then are riveting stories of ordinary men and women, in extraordinary times and threatening situations, making sense of their worlds and facing profound challenges to what matters most in their lives.</p><p><br><strong>Arthur Kleinman</strong> is Esther and Sidney Rabb Professor and Chair, Department of Anthropology, Harvard University, and Professor of Medical Anthropology in Social Medicine and Professor of Psychiatry, Harvard Medical School.

It offers the kind of insight that makes you think and think again. But it isn't only analytical. For me at least, the richness of the book comes mainly from the stories Dr. Kleinman tells, about patients and friends and one remarkable historical figure--complicated stories that confront life's miseries and renew the cheapened word 'inspiring.'"--Tracy Kidder<p></p><br>"In this searingly written book, Arthur Kleinman takes us deep into the contrasting worlds of genuine reality and cultural pretense which he has spent so much of his life exploring. I have rarely read such a powerful portrayal of what Kleinman wonderfully calls 'the quality of anti-heroic everydayness.'"--Jonathan D. Spence<p></p><br>"In this luminous new book, master scholar Arthur Kleinman offers a handful of stories that open a channel between personal experience and the broader contexts--such as war or illness--in which we live our short lives. <em>What Really Matters</em> is a stern yet humble antidote to the shallow self-help books now crowding bestseller lists. It is also an instructive, deeply affecting and, in the end, transcendent and spiritual book."--Dr. Paul Farmer, Founding Director of Partners in Health, and author of <em>Pathologies of Power: Health, Human Rights, and the New War on the Poor</em><p></p><br>"Arthur Kleinman is one of the most broadly informed and wisest people in the life sciences, bridging medicine and the social sciences in a way that is extremely rare and valuable. Moreover, he is an exceptionally keen observer and writes beautifully about matters of great significance. His new book, <em>What Really Matters</em>, is certainly timely when violence is so much in focus and yet it is a contribution of long-term significance." --David A.

Focusing on the decades after the National Park Service was established in 1916, the author reveals the dynamics of policy formulation and change, as landscape architects, foresters, wildlife biologists, and other Park Service professionals contended for dominance and shaped the attitudes and culture of the Service. The book provides a fresh look at the national parks and an analysis of why the Service has not responded in full faith to the environmental concerns of recent times.<br><br>Richard West Sellars, a historian with the National Park Service, has become uniquely familiar with the history, culture, and dynamics of the Service&#x2015;including its biases, internal alliances and rivalries, self-image, folklore, and rhetoric. The book will prove indispensable for environmental and governmental specialists and for general readers seeking an in-depth analysis of one of America&#x2019;s most admired federal bureaus.</p><p><b>Richard W. Sellars</b> is a historian with the National Park Service, Santa Fe, New Mexico.<br>&#34;Preserving Nature inspired the greatest advances in scientific natural resource preservation in the history of the national parks.&#34; Stewart L.

But let&#x2019;s be honest: hedging has never inspired anyone.<br> &nbsp;<br> So what if we stopped hedging? What if we grounded our efforts to solve environmental problems in hope instead, and let nature make our case for us? That&#x2019;s what George Monbiot does in <i>Feral</i>, a lyrical, unabashedly romantic vision of how, by inviting nature back into our lives, we can simultaneously cure our &#x201c;ecological boredom&#x201d; and begin repairing centuries of environmental damage. Monbiot takes readers on an enchanting journey around the world to explore ecosystems that have been &#x201c;rewilded&#x201d;: freed from human intervention and allowed&#x2015;in some cases for the first time in millennia&#x2015;to resume their natural ecological processes. We share his awe, and wonder, as he kayaks among dolphins and seabirds off the coast of Wales and wanders the forests of Eastern Europe, where lynx and wolf packs are reclaiming their ancient hunting grounds. Through his eyes, we see environmental success&#x2015;and begin to envision a future world where humans and nature are no longer separate and antagonistic, but are together part of a single, healing world.<br> &nbsp;<br> Monbiot&#x2019;s commitment is fierce, his passion infectious, his writing compelling. Readers willing to leave the confines of civilization and join him on his bewitching journey will emerge changed&#x2015;and ready to change our world for the better.</p><p>George Monbiot is a journalist, environmentalist, <i>Guardian</i> columnist, and the author of numerous books.&#x201c;As a passionate polemic, <i>Feral</i> could not be more rigorously researched, more elegantly delivered, or more timely. We need such big thinking for our own sakes and those of our children. Bring on the wolves and whales, I say, and, in the words of Maurice Sendak, let the wild rumpus start.&#x201d; (Philip Hoare <i>Sunday Telegraph, Book of the Week</i>)<br><br>"Monbiot challenges the reader to think more deeply on the subject of rewilding. . . . Throughout the book, Monbiot's lyrical and provocative tales of his efforts to reengage with the wild stimulate the senses and arouse an innate urge to affiliate with nature. . . . Monbiot takes you on an emotional roller coaster, at times plunging you into troughs of despair as he discusses the bleak plight of much of our wildlife and, at others, raising you up on peaks of hope as he discusses how much of the degradation can be reversed. . . . Part personal journal, part restoration ecology primer, <i>Feral </i>popularizes the concept of rewilding and will likely prompt wildlife managers, landowners, policy-makers, and the general public to question their perception of the natural world and its role in our lives." (<i>Science</i>)<br><br>"The world knows George Monbiot mostly from his powerful and perceptive journalism. But this is a whole different order of writing and thinking, a primal account of an unstifled world." (Bill McKibben)<br><br>"George Monbiot is always original--both in the intelligence of his opinions and the depth and rigour of his research. In this unusual book he presents a persuasive argument for a new future for the planet, one in which we consciously progress from just conserving nature to actively rebuilding it." (Brian Eno)<br><br><i>"Feral</i>&nbsp;has really opened my mind to the history and possibilities of our landscape. It reflects a very real need in us all right now to be released from our claustrophobic monoculture and sense of powerlessness. To break the straight lines into endless branches. To free our land from its absent administrators. To rewild both the landscape and ourselves. It is the most positive and daring environmental book I have read. In order to change our world you have to be able to see a better one. I think George has done that." (Thom Yorke)<br><br>"Monbiot is at his lyrical best sharing his own very private encounters with the natural world. Then his craving for a 'richer, rawer life' becomes not just compelling but irresistible."

Somewhere along the way, I came to believe that to become a good artist, I needed to acquire an ever increasing knowledge of methods and techniques. May attention to technique garnered me a job as the production artist for a billboard company.&nbsp;After a couple of years painting billboards, I could copy any image given to me in any style, from simple cartoons to photo-realism. By the time, the holy grail of technique seemed disappointingly empty. I had given nearly all of my attention to developing the skills to paint whatever I wanted and very little attention to discovering what I really wanted to paint.&nbsp; For a few years, I taught college drawing and painting classes. While the students gained "the basics," I noticed that for most of them consistent academic study didn't seem to encourage innate joy and enthusiasm for painting. I knew that if I didn't' teach any basics y student would be adrift, eventually becoming frustrated by their lack of ability to correctly mix the colors they needed or to understand what they saw in a painting. I thought that there must be some way to teach artistic skills without getting in the way of a student's unique vision of the world.&nbsp;Surprisingly, my epiphany came with the experience of motherhood. By the time my daughter, Isabella, was eighteen months old, she was painting every day with me. Watching her, I couldn't help but notice that her experience of painting was entirely different form mine. She painted with complete abandon. She was never hard on herself. In facet, when she finished a paint that sh really liked, she'd put her brush down and clap and cheer! If she didn't like it, she quickly pushed it aside and moved on. She never tried to paint like anyone else (especially her mother!).&nbsp;Whenever Isabella finished a painting, she would show it to me. Id' look at the piece and very clearly tell her what I admired about it. Her natural style of learning augmented with my minimal positive insights enabled her to learn quickly and define her own style.During Isabella's toddler years, I was so inspired by her obvious happiness while creating that I decided to take an hour or so each day and paint in the same fashion. The more I opened my mind to painting with the attitude of a child--albeit a very "experienced" child1-- the more my work evolved. Within a few months, my style of painting had completely changed. My work flowered so naturally that the images seemed to paint themselves. I became passionately excited to rediscover that creating could be so simple. My images reflected my joy, and "paint happy" was born! Learning to paint happy was the key that opened my creative soul.&nbsp;Whether you're a new painter or an experienced artist looking for new energy in your work, you will enjoy learning to paint happy. My book guides you to connect with your playful inner spirit while you learn the basics needed to become technically proficient.&nbsp;I don't intend for you to permanently paint images in my style. My style is the result of my particular life experiences. You may wish to copy my exercises as closely as possible, then, taking what you've learned, immediately create an image of your own. With practice, your innate sense of design and personal style will develop.So open this book and enter a world of color. Follow along with your paintbrush in hand, and chapter by chapter the beauty of the world around you and within you will be revealed through your painting.Enjoy!Cristina AcostaRe-connect with the inner artistic spirit of your youth--the imagination, creativity and energy that comes with the release of anxiety and expectation. Cristina Acosta show you how, with guidelines and advice for painting with joyous abandon. Shell help you re-think color mixing and design, while developing your own personal style in acrylic or any other medium. Everything -- even her &#34;lessons&#34; -- is designed to make your painting easier, more satisfying and, most importantly, more fun! Acosta will also teach you how to relax and explore your playful side to create beautiful art, then apply those ideas to your home. She&#39;ll show you how to move beyond the easel to paint tiles, ceramics, furniture and fabric -- even wall murals. Step-by-step examples make experimenting easy.

It is how China and India began to embrace neoliberal ideas of economics and attributed a sense of dignity and liberty to the bourgeoisie they had denied for so long. The result was an explosion in economic growth and proof that economic change depends less on foreign trade, investment, or material causes, and a whole lot more on ideas and what people believe. <br><br>Or so says Deirdre N. McCloskey in <i>Bourgeois Dignity</i>, a fiercely contrarian history that wages a similar argument about economics in the West. Here she turns her attention to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century Europe to reconsider the birth of the industrial revolution and the rise of capitalism. According to McCloskey, our modern world was not the product of new markets and innovations, but rather the result of shifting opinions about them. During this time, talk of private property, commerce, and even the bourgeoisie itself radically altered, becoming far more approving and flying in the face of prejudices several millennia old. The wealth of nations, then, didn&#x2019;t grow so dramatically because of economic factors: it grew because rhetoric about markets and free enterprise finally became enthusiastic and encouraging of their inherent dignity. <br><br>An utterly fascinating sequel to her critically acclaimed book <i>The Bourgeois Virtues, Bourgeois Dignity</i> is a feast of intellectual riches from one of our most spirited and ambitious historians&#x2014;a work that will forever change our understanding of how the power of persuasion shapes our economic lives. <br></p></p><p><b>Deirdre N. McCloskey</b> is Distinguished Professor of Economics, History, English, and Communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago. Among her many books are <i>The Bourgeois Virtues: Ethics for an Age of Commerce</i>; <i>Crossing: A Memoir</i>; <i>The Secret Sins of Economics</i>; and <i>If You&#x2019;re So Smart: The Narrative of Economic Expertise</i>, all published by the University of Chicago Press.<p>&#x201c;The startling perspective McCloskey brings to the history of economics qualifies her as the Max Weber of our times. This is a wonderfully entertaining and stimulating antidote for the reigning view of <i>Homo Economicus</i>.&#x201d;</p> (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi)<br><br>&#x201c;Over a wide range of nations and times, McCloskey advances the arresting thesis that humble ideas, especially those pertaining to the role of a bourgeois dignity, supply the spark that jumpstarts the rest of the process. Readers will be impressed with the breadth of her knowledge, the clarity of her thought, and the sophistication of this finely wrought book.&#x201d; (Richard Epstein)<br><br>&#x201c;Deirdre McCloskey has embarked on a heroic enterprise, the wholesale reconsideration of the modern capitalist economy. The author&#x2019;s lightness of touch is deeply admirable: competing hypotheses from the Protestant Ethic to technological determinism are rounded up and dispatched in a wonderfully invigorating fashion, and not the least of the many virtues of <i>Bourgeois Dignity</i> is the demonstration that serious argument can also be fun.&#x201d; (Alan Ryan)<br><br>"McCloskey's argument runs counter to the prevailing wisdom. However, readers who disagree with her thesis will surely benefit from this exceptionally well-written book, which draws on wide-ranging scholarship that extends well beyond economics proper. . . .

Academic malaise, Adler counters, is rooted in the deficiencies of basic schooling. His concept of Paideia, or general education, runs as a theme throughout these pieces, arguing that the great books approach is successful in the few school districts which have daringly reorganized their resources to teach children in the dialectical, Socratic manner. He updates the great books list to include others from this century: Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time , books by Teilhard De Chardin, Claude Levi-Straus and Saul Bellow. As philosopher, humanistic teacher and educational pioneer, Adler is well viewed in these essays that contribute sound judgment to the controversy of what should be taught in our schools. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.This collection of programmatic essays and occasional pieces argues for the restoration of form and substance to the dishwater mixture we currently call education in America. Adler, the foremost proponent of the Great Books program (adult education at its purest) and the Paedeia Proposal (public school reform), writes eloquently and passionately in defense of a truly democratic vision of education. The best education for the few is the best education for everyone; education for free people must be founded in the discussion of values, encountered in dialogue with great minds as revealed in great books. Education's goal is "citizenship and . . . a life enriched by continuous learning." There is, of course, repetition in an anthology which covers 50 years of writing on educational reform, but even the oldest of these essays seems fresh.

Now, in a volume of astonishing range and originality, Robert Atwan, George Dardess, and Peggy Rosenthal present 280 remarkable poems from world literature focusing on Jesus's life and teaching.<br> Readers accustomed to the predictable inclusions of many anthologies will be surprised and delighted by the diversity of poets represented here, from Aquinas, Dante, de Guevara, Donne, and Sor Juana, to D.H. Lawrence, Gabriela Mistral, Wole Soyinka, Margaret Atwood, Gwendolyn Brooks, Czeslaw Milosz, and Leopold Senghor. Perhaps no other thematically organized anthology could have brought together writers as different as Jorge Luis Borges, Thomas Merton, Alice Walker, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Jack Kerouac. Indeed, simply to turn the page in <em>Divine Inspiration</em> is an adventure in itself. And in terms of form, style, modulations of tone and perspective, the variety here is as unparalleled as it is unpredictable.<br> The editors of <em>Divine Inspiration</em> have done a masterful job of unifying this vast assortment of poems. Organized chronologically around the life of Jesus, the book is divided into nine sections--from Birth and Infancy,through Healings and Miracles, to the Resurrection-- and presents passages from the Gospels followed by the poems they inspired. This structure gives readers the dual pleasures of a strong narrative pull punctuated by moments of lyric intensity. Our familiarity with the life of Jesus is thus enlivened, deepened, and in some cases wholly transformed by the imaginative power of the poems. In the largest section of the book, on the Passion of Jesus, we find an array of poems by Anna Akhmatova, Antonio Machado, Thomas Hardy, Miguel de Unamuno, Charles Baudelaire, R.S. Thomas, Andrew Marvell, Frederico Garcia Lorca, and Denise Levertov, among others. To see the Passion of Jesus refracted through the lenses of such poets is to see it anew, or more vividly than before. And to encounter Chinese, Korean, Nigerian, Arab, Latin American, Scandinavian, Hungarian, and Greek poets alongside English, French, and German is a testimony both to the editors' devoted scholarship and to the power of Jesus's life to inspire great poetry across a spectrum of cultures and eras.<br> An invaluable sourcebook for students, scholars, and general readers alike, <em>Divine Inspiration</em> should prove equally satisfying to readers with a strong interest in religion and to all lovers of poetry.<br></p><p>In a volume of astonishing range and originality, Robert Atwan, George Dardess, and Peggy Rosenthal present 280 poems from world literature focusing on Jesus&#39;s life and teaching.

I wish to demonstrate that when Muslims buried the Prophet, they also buried with him many of the universal values of Islam that he had preached. The history of Islam can be described essentially as the history of an unending power struggle, where men have killed each other to claim the mantle of Muhammad. This strife is a painful story that started within hours of the Prophet closing his eyes forever, and needs to be told. I firmly believe the message of the Quran is strong enough to withstand the facts of history. It is my conviction that Muslims are mature and secure in their identities to face the truth. This is that story. <p><b>Advance Praise for <i>Chasing a Mirage</i></b></p> <p>"Tarek Fatah has written a provocative and challenging book which is a must read for anyone who cares about these issues."<br> &#x2014;Janice Gross Stein</p> <p>"<i>Chasing a Mirage</i> is an extremely valuable contributing to the fight by progressive Muslims against Islamist fascism. This book should be required reading for the Left in the West who have mistakenly started believing that Islamists represent some sort of anti-imperialism."<br> &#x2014;Farooq Tariq</p> <p>"Fatah argues passionatley for universalism instead of exclusivism, integration instead of ghettoism, and makes a powerful appeal for the silent majority of Muslims to speak out before it is too late. This work of courage and daring needs to be read widely."<br> &#x2014;&nbsp;Pervez Hoodbhoy</p> <p>"This fascinating work by brave and bri8lliant tarek Fatah is simultaneously thought-provoking, instructive and enlightening for laymen and scholars, Muslims and non-Muslim...an invaluable and rare addition to the corpus of Islamic literature in the post-9/11 world, a bold step towards Islamic Reformation and Enlightenment."<br> &#x2014;Taj Hashmi</p> <p>"Tarek Fatah's is a voice that needs to be heard. Canada needs a healthy, reasoned debate about the issues he is raising, and indeed so does the world."<br> &#x2014;Bob Rae</p> <p>"This fascinating work by brae and brilliant Tarek Fatah is simultaneously thought-provoking, instructive and enlightening for laymen and scholars, Muslim and non-Muslim... an invaluable and rare addition to the corpus of Islamic literature in the post-9/11 world, a bold step towards Islamic Reformation and Enlightenment."<br> &#x2014;Taj Hashmi</p> <p>"Tarek Fatah's is a voice that needs to be heard. Canada needs a healthy, reasoned debate about the issues he is raising, and indeed so does the world."<br> &#x2014;Bob Rae, Member of Parliament, Canada</p></p><p>In <i>Chasing a Mirage</i>, Tarek Fatah opens a window on the Muslim world that reveals a blighted landscape. Fatah, a Canadian Muslim born in Pakistan, argues that Islam has been hijacked by radicals who falsely invoke the Quran and Prophet Muhammad for their own political purpose that offends the spirit of Islam. <p>At the heart of the matter is the duplicity of imams who decry the West for the ills that affect Muslims. Such invective deflects the failure of most Muslim countries to offer a modicum of freedom, human rights and equality--not ideas that are the purview of western countries, but indeed are inherent in the spirit of Islam. Where did things take such a wrong turn?</p> <p>In the author's assessment, the Quran did not prescribe that Islam should take on a political form--an entity that is the Islamic State. Yet in the aftermath of the Prophet's death, two streams of Islam emerged. One was political and&nbsp;imperial, seeking power and domination, reverberating though the ages and resulting in war bloodshed among Muslim brothers. The other Islam was spiritual, which unleashed the human spirit, triggering an age of enlightenment that once was the hallmark of science, literature, music, and mathematics. The author suggests that the crashing end to Islam's era of intellectual supremacy was a direct result of political Islam inflicting a crushing defeat on the spirit of Islam.</p> <p>In a global movement, Islamists have worked&nbsp;to establish the Islamic State, while Muslims continue to be sacrificed for a cause that s rooted in deceit and delusion.</p> <p>Can a millennia of aggression be brought to a halt? <i>Chasing a Mirage</i> is unequivocal in its answer and in its remedy to end political violence that is inimical to Islam and its state of grace and peace. The book urges Muslims to give up on the Islamic State and strive for the state of Islam.</p>Tarek Fatah is host of the weekly TV show, the Muslim Chronicle, and a frequent contributor to the <i>Toronto Star</i>, the <i>Globe and Mail,</i> and the <i>National Post</i>. A lifelong critic of Islamic extremism, Fatah has earned the ire of Islamists. For his work and perseverance as a writer and broadcaster, despite numerous death threats and intimidation, the National Press Club of Canada awarded Fatah the 2007 Press Freedom Award. Earlier, <i>Macleans</i> magazine named Fatah as one of 50 people it described as "Canada&#x2019;s most well known and respected personalities." In 2002, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal for his work in the community. <p>Born in Pakistan, Fatah was a left-wing student leader in the late 1960s, during which time he was twice imprisoned by successive military dictatorships. He started his career in journalism with the now defunct Karachi newspaper, the <i>SUN,</i> before moving to the Pakistan television network PTV where he won a number of awards for his work as a pioneering investigative reporter. After yet another coup in 1977, Fatah moved to Saudi Arabia where he worked for 10 years in the advertising industry while observing up-close the working of Wahabbi Islam and its global agenda, before migrating to Canada in 1987.</p> <p>In the aftermath of 9/11, Fatah founded the Muslim Canadian Congress, a secular Muslim organization dedicated to the separation of religion and state, opposition to Islamic extremism, and an end to what it describes as &#x201c;gender apartheid&#x201d; that is practised in many parts of the Muslim community.</p> <p>Tarek Fatah lives in Cabbagetown, Toronto with Nargis Tapal, his wife of 33 years, and their two daughters Natasha and Nazia.</p></p><h2>Green Mars</h2><p>In the sequel to Red Mars, as colonists begin to transform Mars into a livable, Earth-like planet, tensions erupt between those who would alter the planet into a paradise for humanity and those who wish to preserve the planet&#39;s harsh, barren beauty.</p><p>Kim Stanley Robinson has earned a reputation as the master of Mars fiction, writing books that are scientific, sociological and, best yet, fantastic. <b>Green Mars</b> continues the story of humans settling the planet in a process called "terraforming." In Red Mars, the initial work in the trilogy, the first 100 scientists chosen to explore the planet disintegrated in disagreement--in part because of pressures from forces on Earth. Some of the scientists formed a loose network underground. <b>Green Mars</b>, which won the 1994 Hugo Award, follows the development of the underground and the problems endemic to forming a new society.In the "Nebula Award winning Red Mars, Kim Stanley Robinson began his critically acclaimed epic saga of the colonization of Mars, Now the "Hugo Award winning Green Mars continues the thrilling and timeless tale of humanity's struggle to survive at its farthest frontier. <br>Nearly a generation has passed since the first pioneers landed, but the transformation of Mars to an Earthlike planet has just begun The plan is opposed by those determined to preserve the planets hostile, barren beauty. Led by rebels like Peter Clayborne, these young people are the first generation of children born on Mars. They will be joined by original settlers Maya Toitovna, Simon Frasier, and Sax Russell. Against this cosmic backdrop, passions, rivalries, and friendships explode in a story as spectacular as the planet itself.</p><h2>Operation Barbarossa: Nazi Germany&#39;s War in the East, 1941-1945</h2><p>The war between Nazi Germany and Stalin's Soviet Union that raged between 1941 and 1945 was the ultimate confrontation between the two great totalitarian ideologies of the twentieth century. Unprecedented in the scale of the destruction that it wrought and the deep historical scars that it left behind, it was a gargantuan conflict in every sense of the term: in the vast territories over which it ranged, its intensity and duration, the huge numbers of people involved, and last but by no means least, the millions of victims that it claimed.<br><br>The invasion of the Soviet Union was the conflict that Hitler had always ultimately planned for: a pitiless war of conquest and destruction in which the Fuehrer dreamed of creating his 'Thousand Year Reich', destroying his ideological opponents, and enslaving or 'eliminating' whole peoples in the process. It was right from the start a struggle for survival, conducted with great bitterness and savagery by opponents who knew that defeat meant the destruction of everything they stood for.<br><br>The outcome of this bitter struggle was quite as momentous as the struggle which had preceded it. By 1945 a huge swathe of Europe between Berlin and Moscow had been reduced to a devastated wasteland in which whole societies had been erased from the face of the earth. Over 26 million Soviets and between four and five million Germans lay dead. The victory of the Red Army transformed the Soviet Union into one of the world's two superpowers. It also saw the complete destruction of Hitler's megalomaniac vision for the East, the division of the German Reich, and the Soviet domination of Eastern Europe for a generation.<br><br>In <em>Operation Barbarossa</em>, German military historian Christian Hartmann draws upon the latest research, enriched by a wealth of eye-witness testimony from both the Soviet and the German sides, to paint a masterly overview of these momentous four years and their human consequences--one that is both gripping and at times deeply moving.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christian Hartmann</strong> works as a historian at the Institute for Contemporary History, Munich, and is Senior Lecturer at the Staff College of the German Armed Forces in Hamburg. A board member of the German Committee for the History of the Second World War, he is also a historical adviser to the History Channel in Germany. He has published widely on the history of Germany in the Second World War, including a biography of General Halder, head of the Wehrmacht General Staff in the opening years of the war, and is the editor of four volumes in the German Documents on Foreign Policy series.<br>In terms of troops engaged, material, casualties, and geographic scope, WWII on the Eastern Front dwarfed the Allied efforts against Germany in the west. In addition, as Hartmann repeatedly illustrates, the struggle between the totalitarian powers, Germany and the Soviet Union, was fought with almost unprecedented savagery and was openly viewed and espoused by some Germans as a war of annihilation. Hartmann, a historian and consultant to the History Channel in Germany, first published this compact, fast-moving account that manages to cover the major military campaigns while conveying a sense of how ordinary soldiers on both sides experienced the combat in Germany, in 2011. He offers some interesting assertions and rejects some revisionists&#x2019; claim that Hitler&#x2019;s attack was preventive, since Hitler always planned to seize European Russia. Despite the supposed technological superiority of the Wehrmacht, Hartmann shows that Germans quickly became dependent on horses and carts to move across vast areas. This is a superbly written survey of a seminal conflict that is ideal for general readers. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Rock Music: Culture, Aesthetics and Sociology</h2><p>Rock music--powerful, sensual, loud, and full of energy.

In vivid portraits of parish life, John McGreevy examines the contacts and conflicts between Euro-American Catholics and their African-American neighbors. By tracing the transformation of a church, its people, and the nation, McGreevy illuminates the enormous impact of religious culture on modern American society.<br> <br> "<i>Parish Boundaries</i> can take its place in the front ranks of the literature of urban race relations."&#x2014;Jonathan Dorfman, <i>Washington Post Book Review</i><br> <br> "A prodigiously researched, gracefully written book distinguished especially by its seamless treatment of social and intellectual history."&#x2014;Robert Orsi, <i>American Historical Review</i><br> <br> "<i>Parish Boundaries</i> will fascinate historians and anyone interested in the historic connection between parish and race."&#x2014;Ed Marciniak, <i>Chicago Tribune</i><br> <br> "The history that remains to be written will rest on the firm foundation of Mr. McGreevy's remarkable book."&#x2014;Richard Wightman Fox, <i>New York Times Book Review</i></p></p><p>In the summer of 1974, a crowd of Irish-American Catholics in south Boston, protesting the introduction of busing, screamed abuse and threw eggs at Edward Kennedy as he walked into a public elementary school leading a little black girl by the hand. It was a moment redolent of the ironies and passions of American Catholicism&#39;s divisions over racism. As McGreevy&#39;s excellent history reveals, that protest mob reflected a wider struggle within the church. Many priests and nuns were in the forefront of the civil rights movement. And yet, such liberals often acted without taking into account the fears and insecurities of the traditionally white and working-class congregations in the local parishes. McGreevy vividly brings to life this struggle within the church between a universal vision and a parochial one.Steeples topped by crosses still dominate neighborhood skylines in many American cities, silent markers of local worlds rarely examined by historians. In Parish Boundaries, John McGreevy chronicles the history of these Catholic parishes and connects their unique place in the urban landscape to the course of American race relations in the twentieth century. In vivid portraits of parish life in Boston, Chicago, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia, and other cities, McGreevy examines the contacts and conflicts between Euro-American Catholics and their African-American neighbors. He demonstrates how the territorial nature of the parish - more bound by geography than Protestant or Jewish congregations - kept Catholics in their neighborhoods, and how this commitment to place complicated efforts to integrate urban neighborhoods. He also shows how the church responded to the growing number of African-American parishioners by condemning racism, and how this teaching was received in communities rocked by racial strife. Taking the story through the Second Vatican Council and the civil rights movement of the 1960s, McGreevy demonstrates how debates about community and racial justice helped trigger a more general reevaluation of the character of American Catholicism.</p><h2>Words of Wisdom (LeatherLike): A Life-Changing Journey through Psalms and Proverbs</h2><p>Dr. Billy Graham says in the <i>Words of Wisdom</i> foreword, &#x201c;The Psalms tell us how to get along with God, and the Proverbs tell us how to get along with our fellow man.&#x201d; As has long been Dr. Graham&#x2019;s personal practice, <i>Words of Wisdom</i> makes it easy for anyone to read five Psalms and a chapter from Proverbs each day for 31 days.

Written after Du Bois had earned his Ph.D. from Harvard and studied in Berlin, these fourteen essays contain both the academic language of sociology and the rich lyricism of African spirituals, which Du Bois called &#x201c;sorrow songs.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Often revealingly autobiographical, Du Bois explores topics as diverse as the death of his infant son and the politics of Booker T. Washington. In every essay, he shows the consequences of both a political color line and an internal one, as he grapples with the contradictions of being black and being American. What emerges is a manifesto calling for a new class of African-American intellectuals and a transcendent program for change. One of our country&#x2019;s most influential books, <b>The Souls of Black Folk</b> reflects the mind of a visionary who inspired generations of readers to remember the past, question the status quo, and fight for a just tomorrow.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p>William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868-1963) is the greatest of African American intellectuals--a sociologist, historian, novelist, and activist whose astounding career spanned the nation's history from Reconstruction to the civil rights movement. Born in Massachusetts and educated at Fisk, Harvard, and the University of Berlin, Du Bois penned his epochal masterpiece, <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, in 1903. It remains his most studied and popular work; its insights into Negro life at the turn of the 20th century still ring true.<p> With a dash of the Victorian and Enlightenment influences that peppered his impassioned yet formal prose, the book's largely autobiographical chapters take the reader through the momentous and moody maze of Afro-American life after the Emancipation Proclamation: from poverty, the neoslavery of the sharecropper, illiteracy, miseducation, and lynching, to the heights of humanity reached by the spiritual "sorrow songs" that birthed gospel and the blues. The most memorable passages are contained in "On Booker T. Washington and Others," where Du Bois criticizes his famous contemporary's rejection of higher education and accommodationist stance toward white racism: "Mr. Washington's programme practically accepts the alleged inferiority of the Negro races," he writes, further complaining that Washington's thinking "withdraws many of the high demands of Negroes as men and American citizens." The capstone of <i>The Souls of Black Folk</i>, though, is Du Bois' haunting, eloquent description of the concept of the black psyche's "double consciousness," which he described as "a peculiar sensation.... One ever feels this twoness--an American, a Negro; two souls, two thoughts, two unreconciled strivings; two warring ideals in one dark body, whose dogged strength alone keeps it from being torn asunder." Thanks to W.E.B. Du Bois' commitment and foresight--and the intellectual excellence expressed in this timeless literary gem--black Americans can today look in the mirror and rejoice in their beautiful black, brown, and beige reflections. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line." Thus speaks W.E.B. Du Bois in <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i>, one of the most prophetic and influental works in American literature. In this eloquent collection of essays, first published in 1903, Du Bois dares as no one has before to describe the magnitude of American racism and demand an end to it. He draws on his own life for illustration, from his early experiences teaching in the hills of Tennessee to the death of his infant son and his historic break with the conciliatory position of Booker T. Washington.<p></p><p>Far ahead of its time, <i>The Souls Of Black Folk</i> both anticipated and inspired much of the black conciousness and activism of the 1960's and is a classic in the literature of civil rights. The elegance of DuBois's prose and the passion of his message are as crucial today as they were upon the book's first publication.</p></p><h2>Biblical Interpretation: Past &amp; Present</h2><p><ul><li>Voted one of <em>Christianity Today's</em> 1997 Books of the Year</li></ul> Never before has there been so much scholarly effort devoted to the study of the Bible. And yet, ironically, the church is in perilous danger of forgetting its rich inheritance of biblical interpretation. With this textbook, Gerald Bray sounds the call to draw biblical interpretation back to the heart of the church. Evangelical in perspective but ecumenical in both its historical breadth and its vision of the future, Bray's work is a comprehensive guide to biblical interpretation, past and present. Bray begins by introducing basic concepts in biblical interpretation that have remained constant through the ages: divine revelation, the nature of the canon, the relation of the biblical text to the life of Christian churches, and the tensions inherent in the act of biblical interpretation. He follows this introduction with three main sections, each covering an epoch of development within the history of biblical interpretation. The first surveys the period from the ancient church to the beginnings of modern historical-critical interpretation in the Renaissance and Reformation. The second engages the rise of modern historical-critical interpretation from the late seventeenth century through the twentieth century. The third investigates current trends in biblical interpretation that seek to offer alternatives to the dominant school of historical criticism. Each section is divided into chapters focusing on periods or schools of interpretation. And, as a further aid to readers, each chapter is divided into standard subsections: <ul><li>an introduction to the period or school of interpretation</li><li>a brief who's who of major interpreters and their works</li><li>an introduction to key critical, doctrinal or hermeneutical issues</li><li>discussion and illustration of principal interpretive methods</li><li>an examination of an particular book or passage that played a crucial role in biblical interpretation for the period or school under discussion</li></ul> Bray's organizational scheme allows readers to quickly grasp the issues, methods and interpreters of each period or school and to observe how classic issues and pivotal questions have shaped the church's use of the Bible in various historical contexts. Seminarians, pastors, teachers and lay leaders will welcome <em>Biblical Interpretation: Past and Present</em> as an instructive guide to both the high points and the impasses of biblical interpretation. Here is history with a clear message, written out of the conviction that biblical interpretation and Christian doctrine go hand in hand.</p><p>Gerald L. Bray (Ph.D., La Sorbonne) is a professor at Beeson Divinity School of Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, and director of research at Latimer Trust. He has written and edited a number of books on different theological subjects. A priest of the Church of England, Bray has also edited the post-Reformation Anglican canons.</p><h2>Lilith the First Eve</h2><p>In a fascinating excursion through the history of her myth, Siegmund Hurwitz presents and interprets the ancient dark-winged goddess Lilith, also known as &#x2019;the first Eve.&#x2019; The author&#x2019;s extraordinarily meticulous study of the original sources brings to light a striking figure long lost from our awareness, yet highly relevant to a psychological understanding of today&#x2019;s evolving masculine and feminine identities. Case material from his analytical practice imbeds Lilith in the everyday problems of contemporary life. "That an unbridled life-urge which refuses to be assimilated lies behind depression seems to me to be a new and important discovery. By combining the experience of a contemporary man with this historical material, Siegmund Hurwitz sheds new light on both." -- From the Foreword by Marie-Louise von Franz.</p><p>Dr. Seigmund Hurwitz was a member of the innermost circle of C.G. Jung&#39;s so called Zurich school and he received his analytical training from Jung, Toni Wolff and Marie-Louise von Franz. He was long a scholar of Jewish mysticism and, with his gift for language, was often sought out by Jung and others when there were ancient texts to be consulted. Dr. Hurwitz published numerous articles and books over the course of his long lifetime, and he continues to maintain a small analytical practice in Zurich until his death in the Summer of 1994.</p><h2>Shaped By God&#39;s Heart: The Passion and Practices of Missional Churches</h2><p>Discover the tools to create a new kind of church and move from merely surviving to thriving.<br> Drawing on an extensive two-year field study of 200 churches from a variety of denominations and geographic regions, Milfred Minatrea--a missiologist, urban strategist and practioner in minister--presents the best practices for re-energizing Christian spirituality in a congregational setting. He provides readers with the tools for assessing their congregation&#x2019;s position on the continuum between maintenance and mission and for determining the actions that will move them toward becoming a missional community. He also outlines key strategies that successful churches have used to become relevant in a postmodern society without losing what is distinctly Christian in their spiritual practices. <p>Milfred Minatrea (Irving, TX) is Director of the Missional Church Center for the Baptist General Convention of Texas.</p></p><p>A Guide for Moving Churches from Merely Surviving to Thriving <p>"Shaped by God&#x2019;s Heart is a stimulating contribution to the growing and increasingly diverse engagement in the vision of the missional church. Mifred Minatrea has drawn together insights from a remarkable spectrum of resources, which he synthesizes in strategies for missional transformation and which reward careful reading and provoke further exploration. His carefully thought-out proposals invite experimentation and innovation. This constructive work is encouraging to anyone concerned about the missional faithfulness of the Christian church in North America."<br> &#x2013;Darrell L. Guder, Henry Winters Luce Professor of Missional and Ecumenical Theology, Princeton Theological Seminary</p> <p>"Milfred Minatrea is a pilgrim not a conquistador. His book is not a map drawn by someone who&#x2019;s conquered the land. It is a compass with a true north, that points to survival in the secular wilderness where Christ himself is waiting on vitality to knock. Read and the compass is yours. Knock and the door will open. This book does not point the way to church growth. It calls the reader to honest pilgrimage&#x2013;to find the way to meaningful faith. Milfred Minatrea knows that where meaning is married to hope, vitality is born."<br> &#x2013;Calvin Miller, professor of divinity, Beeson Divinity School, Samford University</p> <p>"Mifred Minatrea has distilled the essence of what it means to be a missional church. The insightful summarization and articulation of distinctive practices can be the launch pad for every courageous church leader who wants to bring Kingdom impact to their world both locally and globally."<br> &#x2013;Carol Davis, executive director, Global Spectrum, and consultant to mission leaders around the world</p> <p>"Milfred Minatrea is missional! This book will be invaluable to churches who want to join the missional journey in the twenty-first century."<br> &#x2013;William Tinsley, WorldconneX; author, The Jesus Encounter</p>Increasingly, today&#x2019;s churches have become isolated from rather than engaged in the world. Many ministers and lay leaders&#x2013;who have stable churches, good relationships with their congregations, and useful ministries&#x2013;feel there is something vital missing. <p>Shaped by God&#x2019;s Heart reveals that it&#x2019;s not the church&#x2019;s activity level that defines success but whether its activities accomplish God&#x2019;s mission for His church. This book helps ministers and church leaders move beyond mere survival and maintenance toward a thriving missional mode for their congregations. Missional congregations become fully relevant to today&#x2019;s society without losing what is distinctively Christian in their spiritual practices.</p> <p>This important resource draws on an extensive two-year field study of two hundred churches from a variety of denominations and geographic regions. Milfred Minatrea&#x2013;a missiologist, urban strategist, and practitioner in ministry&#x2013;shows how these vibrant congregations are abandoning themselves to God&#x2019;s purpose in mission and presents the best practices for reenergizing Christian spirituality in a congregational setting. Shaped by God&#x2019;s Heart includes a Missional Practice Assessment tool to evaluate a congregation&#x2019;s position on the continuum between maintenance and mission and to determine the actions that will move the congregation toward becoming a true missional community.</p> <p>As Minatrea emphasizes, knowing God&#x2019;s purpose and pursuing it with deep passion, is the first step in becoming missional. Minatrea outlines the nine common practices that characterize missional churches. In addition, each of the book&#x2019;s chapters contain relevant exercises for reflection and application as well as resources for additional study.</p> <p>Once transformed, missional churches have a profound effect on their members&#x2019; lives out in the world. Their influence results in new followers of Christ and the development of new communities of faith.</p></p><h2>A Simple Monk: Writings on His Holiness the Dalai Lama</h2><p>Lavish color photographs and wrap-around text celebrate the peripatetic spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism. Unidentified contributors present such perspectives as ocean of wisdom, the god in exile, and human rights and universal responsibility. There is no index or bibliography. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>The regal gift anthology <i>A Simple Monk</i> stands apart from the glut of books about the 14th Dalai Lama. Alison Wright's glorious photographs deliver a visual feast of the landscape and people of Tibet, as well as the face of the Dalai Lama--all of which contain an inspiring blend of serenity and joy against a backdrop of political suffering. Like the photography, the six essays educate readers while avoiding hyperbole and guru worship. One of the most compelling contributions comes from the Dalai Lama's mother, Diki Tsering, who speaks of her son with frank authority. Who would have thought that this peaceful monk was once a 1-year-old tyrant? When he toddled upon people quarreling, he'd pick up a stick and "try to beat them," according to his mother. In straightforward prose, she also recounts the many omens and coincidences that pointed to her son being the next Dalai Lama. Other essays include an interview conducted by Spalding Gray, in which the Dalai Lama speaks of his daily meditation practice (from 4 to 8 a.m.), how he overcomes fear of terrorism and flying, and how he resists the allure of bikini-clad women at the swimming pool. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>This "visual biography" of His Holiness the Fourteenth Dalai Lama blends gorgeous photography with text that is surprisingly sharp. Photographer Wright (The Spirit of Tibet), who has lived in India for the last decade chronicling the experiences of the Tibetan community in exile, relies heavily on vibrant colors such as red, orange and monastic saffron to bring these images to life. She offers illuminating portraits of the Dalai Lama himself, as well as cinema verit&#x201a;-style photographs of ordinary Tibetans at play and worship. Mercifully, she omits hackneyed images of His Holiness posing with this or that Hollywood celebrity. This restrained attitude toward the Buddha-loving glitterati is wittily reinforced in Orville Schell's essay, "Searching for the Dalai Lama: Dispirited Stars Find Absolution in Buddhism." Schell discusses Richard Gere's two decades as a Buddhist practitioner and then gives the slip to other stars such as Steven Seagal, who apparently sees Buddhism as just another vehicle for self-aggrandizement. As a whole, the book demonstrates a refreshing lack of awe for His Holiness, although it is always deeply respectful. An early chapter from Diki Tsering's book Dalai Lama, My Son presents a mother's surprisingly matter-of-fact, unsentimental reminiscences of the Tibetan leader's infancy and boyhood, while Columbia University professor Robert Thurman takes the Dalai Lama's mission into the next age with "Hope for the Third Millennium," excerpted from his Inner Revolution. For coffee-table fare, this is intelligent stuff. (Oct. 30)Forecast: Stunning full-color photography and well-chosen text make this 10" book stand out among the many titles about the Dalai Lama. Advertising in Buddhist and New Age publications should help move the book's 50,000-copy print run. It is a main selection of the One Spirit Book Club.<p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Designing Visual Language: Strategies for Professional Communicators (The Allyn &amp; Bacon Series in Technical Communication)</h2><p><p>Written by two highly experienced teachers in the field of document design, <i>Designing Visual Language,</i> 2/e offers useful strategies and tools for document design of all types. A chief goal of the text is to enable students to extend the rhetorical approach they employ in writing and editing courses to the creation of various forms of visual communication. The text focuses on the kinds of situations and practical documents that occur in the workplace and blends this focus with a rhetorical approach that ties design to the audience, purpose, and context of messages. </p></p><p></p><h2>Christ and Sophia: Anthroposophic Meditations on the Old Testament, New Testament, and Apocalypse</h2><p>In these astounding meditations on the true Christian nature of the scriptures, Tomberg shows how the central story of entire Bible is really a history of the Christ being. He describes the cosmic and earthly preparations for the Mystery of Golgotha, its significance and results for humanity and the world as a whole, and the central role of the Sophia being and her relationship to the Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Disciples and Pentecost, and all of humanity. He also imagines the Grail nature of the Christ's involvement in earthly history. <br><br> All of Valentin Tomberg's profound studies are finally available in a single volume! Drawn from four difficult-to-find and out-of-print editions, this completely revised and updated text includes Tomberg's anthroposophic meditations on the Old Testament, the New Testament, and the Apocalypse, while the appendix contains his final, unfinished work, "The Four Sacrifices of Christ." <br><br> <i><b>Christ and Sophia</b></i> contains all of Valentin Tomberg's essential anthroposophic works on the scriptures, providing an invaluable resource for anyone who wishes to gain a deeper understanding of Rudolf Steiner's spiritual scientific approach to esoteric Christianity, as revealed by a close, meditative reading of the Bible&#x2015;from Genesis to John's Revelation. <br><br> This volume contains English translations of these works by Valentin Tomberg: <i>Anthroposophisch Betrachtungen �ber des Alte Testament; Anthroposophische Betrachtungen �ber das Neue Testament; Geisteswissenschaftliche Betrachtungen �ber die Apokalypse des Johannes.</i></p><p><b>Valentin Tomberg</b> (Feb. 27, 1900&#x2013;Feb. 24, 1973) was born into a Lutheran family in St. Petersburg, Russia. As an adolescent, he was drawn to the hermetic Martinism of G.O.Mebes, as well as to Theosophy and the mysticism of Eastern Orthodoxy. Tomberg&#x2019;s mother was killed by looters during the Russian Revolution, after which Valentin and his father fled to Tallinn, Estonia, where Tomberg studied languages and comparative religion at the University of Tartu. As a young man, he was strongly influenced by Vladimir Soloviev and had a personal experience of the Sophia at a cathedral in Holland. In 1925, he joined the Anthroposophical Society, under whose auspices he lectured in Holland and England and wrote on his understanding of the Bible, Anthroposophy, and esoteric Christianity. During World War II, he left the Anthroposophical Society and its internal struggles and converted to Catholicism. In 1948, he moved to England, where he became a translator for the BBC and monitored Soviet broadcasts during the Cold War, while continuing his devotion to meditation practice and further writing on his esoteric insights. In 1960, he retired to Reading near the River Thames. He died while vacationing in Majorca. The best-known work of his later life is <i>Meditations on the Tarot: A Journey into Christian Hermeticism,</i> written anonymously.</p><h2>Complete Fairy Tales of Oscar Wilde (Signet Classics)</h2><p><b>The master of wit and irony</b><br><br> Published here alongside their evocative original illustrations, these fairy tales, as Oscar Wilde himself explained, were written &#x201c;partly for children, and partly for those who have kept the childlike faculties of wonder and joy.&#x201d;</p><p><b>Oscar Wilde</b> (1854&#x2013;1900) was an Irish writer, poet, and playwright.

Chapters address methods of arguing liability and damages in various types of personal injury cases, emphasizing the most effective approaches to relating the evidence and argument to the specific questions the jury must answer. If you primarily represent defendants, you will also find it helpful to review techniques the author describes to encourage large verdicts. But the extraordinary thing about this book is that all the practical tips, from basic forensic principles to how to help jurors develop a positive perception of your clients, couched in a cogent wit that is highly entertaining.<p> Every Trial lawyer will be entertained and enlightened by Who Will Speak for the Victim? Although it is written by a personal injury plaintiff's lawyer from that perspective, defense counsel, as well as lawyers engaged in business, corporate, and family law litigation, will find that many of the concepts and principles this book discusses apply equally to their diverse specialties.</p><p> Dozens of accounts of actual courtroom scenes illustrate jury persuasion and argument techniques that work-and those that don't. Basic forensic principles, such as posture, movement, vocal tone and pitch, and verbal content, are explored in these instructive pages, along with more advanced techniques like the art of subliminal persuasion. This readable book will help every trial advocate not only to develop more compelling arguments but also to present summations that are entertaining and provocative.</p><p> For the plaintiff's advocate, chapters address methods of arguing liability and damages in various types of personal injury cases. The last four chapters present complete summations, taken from actual cases, that tie together the techniques and concepts explored throughout the book.</p></p><p></p><h2>Strategic Management</h2><p>Contemporary research in strategic management, with an emphasis on conceptual tools and skills created by scholars and practitioners in the field are evident throughout <i>Strategic Management</i>, 13e.

Seemingly impossible to penetrate, this lost world holds great danger for the four men, whether from fiendish ape-men or terrifying prehistoric creatures. Arthur Conan Doyle&#39;s classic tale of adventure and discovery still excites the reader today just as dinosaurs continue to grip the popular imagination.</p><p>Forget the Michael Crichton book (and Spielberg movie) that copied the title. This is the original: the terror-adventure tale of <i>The Lost World</i>. Writing not long after dinosaurs first invaded the popular imagination, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle spins a yarn about an expedition of two scientists, a big-game hunter, and a journalist (the narrator) to a volcanic plateau high over the vast Amazon rain forest. The bickering of the professors (a type Doyle knew well from his medical training) serves as witty contrast to the wonders of flora and fauna they encounter, building toward a dramatic moonlit chase scene with a Tyrannosaurus Rex. And the character of Professor George E. Challenger is second only to Sherlock Holmes in the outrageous force of his personality: he's a big man with an even bigger ego, and if you can grit your teeth through his racist behavior toward Native Americans, he's a lot of fun.6 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>What It Takes to Be #1 : Vince Lombardi on Leadership</h2><p><p><b>Legendary leadership lessons from the greatest football coach of all time</b></p> <p>Leadership continues to be one of the most trained-for skills in business today.

Although calories are essential to human health and survival, they cannot be seen, smelled, or tasted. They are also hard to understand. In <i>Why Calories Count,</i> Marion Nestle and Malden Nesheim explain in clear and accessible language what calories are and how they work, both biologically and politically. As they take readers through the issues that are fundamental to our understanding of diet and food, weight gain, loss, and obesity, Nestle and Nesheim sort through a great deal of the misinformation put forth by food manufacturers and diet program promoters. They elucidate the political stakes and show how federal and corporate policies have come together to create an eat more&#x201d; environment. Finally, having armed readers with the necessary information to interpret food labels, evaluate diet claims, and understand evidence as presented in popular media, the authors offer some candid advice: Get organized. Eat less. Eat better. Move more. Get political.</p><p>"If you want to understand what's wrong with our eating habits, you must understand the central role that calories play. Nestle and Nesheim are two of America's finest nutritionists and this book explains, clearly and succinctly, why calories count. It is essential reading not only for people interested in food policy, but for everyone who wants to eat well and be well." Eric Schlosser, author of <i>Fast Food Nation: The Dark Side of the All-American Meal</i><br> <br> "This superbly well-researched and scientifically sound book makes it clear how today&#x2019;s food environment often overrides physiological regulatory controls of body weight. <i>Why Calories Count</i> is essential reading for anyone who wants to understand why so much about food choice lies in the hands of food marketers whose goal is to sell more products, not necessarily in the interests of public health." Dr. David Kessler, author of <i>The End of Overeating: Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite</i><br> <br> We need to understand what empty calories&#x2019; are, so that we can feed our children food that is truly nourishing. On this topic, there is no better teacher than Marion Nestle, who writes with meticulousness, clarity and grace.&#x201d; Alice Waters, author of <i>The Art of Simple Food: Notes, Lessons, and Recipes from a Delicious Revolution</i><br> <br> "Thank god authorities like Nestle and Nesheim have teamed up to give us an epic view of a calorie: what it is, where it came from, what it means, how and why we count them. Thank god they&#x2019;ve managed to decode nutritional science into a commonsense language we can all understand. And thank god they&#x2019;ve put calories in their place in a wider cultural and political context to help us think meaningfully about the food our lives depend upon. I&#x2019;m grateful." Betty Fussell, author of <i>Raising Steaks: The Life &amp; Times of American Beef</i><br> <br> Calories. We all talk about them many are even obsessed with them but what do we really know about them? Not much. Marion Nestle and Malden Nesheim&#x2019;s latest book changes all that, pulling back the curtain on calories and helping us understand them in a whole new light.

However, very little is known about how their historical and contemporary relationship with America may shape their psychological experiences. The most insidious psychological consequence of their historical and contemporary experiences is colonial mentality or internalized oppression. Some common manifestations of this phenomenon are described below:&nbsp;<br>*Skin-whitening products are used often by Filipinos in the Philippines to make their skins lighter. Skin whitening clinics and businesses are popular in the Philippines as well. The "beautiful" people such as actors and other celebrities endorse these skin-whitening procedures. Children are told to stay away from the sun so they do not get "too dark." Many Filipinos also regard anything "imported" to be more special than anything "local" or made in the Philippines.&nbsp;*In the United States, many Filipino Americans make fun of "fresh-off-the-boats" (FOBs) or those who speak English with Filipino accents. Many Filipino Americans try to dilute their "Filipino-ness" by saying that they are mixed with some other races. Also, many Filipino Americans regard Filipinos in the Philippines, and pretty much everything about the Philippines, to be of "lower class" and those of the "third world."&nbsp;The historical and contemporary reasons for why Filipino -/ Americans display these attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors - often referred to as colonial mentality - are explored in Brown Skin, White Minds. This book is a peer-reviewed publication that integrates knowledge from multiple scholarly and scientific disciplines to identify the past and current catalysts for such self-denigrating attitudes and behaviors. It takes the reader from indigenous Tao culture, Spanish and American colonialism, colonial mentality or internalized oppression along with its implications on Kapwa, identity, and mental health, to decolonization in the clinical, community, and research settings. This book is intended for the entire community - teachers, researchers, students, and service providers interested in or who are working with Filipinos and Filipino Americans, or those who are interested in the psychological consequences of colonialism and oppression. This book may serve as a tool for remembering the past and as a tool for awakening to address the present.</p><p><i>"Simply put, Dr. David's work is an act of psychological liberation. Through his command of the research, his skillful integration of both history and psychology, and his self-evident passion, he challenges Filipinos and Filipino Americans to look in the mirror and examine the psychological impact of Spanish and American colonialism. More importantly, his work is also an act of hope...hope that rests with the invitation to decolonize ourselves and our communities and to see ourselves and our histories with both clarity and pride.

It is unlikely that they will be told that a diagnosis will be written forever in their chart and that alarming consequences can result solely from having any psychiatric diagnosis. It would be disturbing enough if diagnosis was a thoroughly scientific process, but it is not, and its unscientific nature creates a vacuum into which biases of all kinds can rush. Bias in Psychiatric Diagnosis is the first book ever published about how gender, race, social class, age, physical disability, and sexual orientation affect the classification of human beings into categories of psychiatric diagnosis. It is surprising that this kind of book is not yet on the market, because it is such a hot topic, and the negative consequences of psychiatric diagnosis range from loss of custody of a child to denial of health insurance and employment to removal of one&#39;s right to make decisions about one&#39;s legal affairs. It is an unusually compelling book because of its real-life relevance for millions of people. Virtually everyone these days has been a therapy patient or has a loved one who has been. In addition, psychiatric diagnosis and biases in diagnosis are increasingly crucial portions of, or the main subject of, legal proceedings. This book should sit next to every doctor&#39;s PDR, especially given the skyrocketing use of psychoactive drugs in toddlers, children, and adolescents, as well as in adults, and especially because receiving a psychiatric label vastly increases the chances of being prescribed one or more of these drugs.

Roosevelt</h2><p>Robert H. Jackson was one of the giants of the Roosevelt era: an Attorney General, a still revered Supreme Court Justice and, not least important, one of Franklin Delano Roosevelt's close friends and advisers. His intimate memoir of FDR, written in the early 1950s before Jackson's untimely death, has remained unpublished for fifty years. Here is that newly discovered memoir.<br> Written with skill and grace, this is truly a unique account of the personality, conduct, greatness of character, and common humanity of "that man in the White House," as outraged conservatives called FDR. Jackson simply but eloquently provides an insider's view of Roosevelt's presidency, including such crucial events as FDR's Court-packing plan, his battles with corporate America, his decision to seek a third term, and his bold move to aid Britain in 1940 with American destroyers. He also offers an intimate personal portrait of Roosevelt--on fishing trips, in late-night poker games, or approving legislation while eating breakfast in bed, where he routinely began his workday. We meet a president who is far-sighted but nimble in attacking the problems at hand; principled but flexible; charismatic and popular but unafraid to pick fights, take stands, and when necessary, make enemies. <br> <em>That Man</em> is not simply a valuable historical document, but an engaging and insightful look at one of the most remarkable men in American history. In reading this memoir, we gain not only a new appreciation for Roosevelt, but also admiration for Jackson, who emerges as both a public servant of great integrity and skill and a wry, shrewd, and fair-minded observer of politics at the highest level.</p><p><br><strong>Robert H. Jackson</strong> was Associate Justice of the Supreme Court from 1941 to his death in 1954. A major figure in American legal history, he also served as Solicitor General and Attorney General of the United States, and the American Chief Prosecutor at the Nuremberg Trial. Author of the best-selling <em>The N�rnberg Case</em>, he is considered by many to be the finest writer ever to sit on the Supreme Court. <strong>John Q. Barrett</strong> is Professor of Law at St. John's University in New York and Elizabeth S. Lenna Fellow at the Robert H. Jackson Center in Jamestown, New York. He formerly served in the office of Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh investigating Iran-Contra, and in the U.S. Department of Justice. He discovered the manuscript of <em>That Man</em> among Jackson's papers while researching a biography of the Justice. <strong>William E. Leuchtenburg</strong>, the leading historian of Roosevelt and the New Deal, has contributed a foreword discussing Jackson's relationship with FDR.<br><br>"Lively, revealing and suddenly relevant.... Jackson's memoir sheds new light--not always flattering--on important events and on a president who too often appears only in silhouette: a felt fedora, an upward-tilting chin, a cigarette holder clenched in a grin."--Jeff Shesol, <em>New York Times Book</em> <em>Review</em><p></p><br>"The publication of this slender but meaty book is that rare and happy event: a voice speaking to us from the past, a voice we had not expected to hear and that brings the past to life as not even the best of historians can do."--Jonathan Yardley, <em>The Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"A winning memoir--the story of Jackson's life in the White House; a powerful portrait of our 32nd president; and, most of all, a tribute to the humanity and the vision that stood at the heart of the Roosevelt administration.... A unique historical find.... It contains a trove of new information about Roosevelt's life."--Matthew Dallek, <em>The Washington Monthly</em><p></p><br>"A thoughtful, fresh, useful look at FDR. With powerful respect, even awe, for the man, Jackson nevertheless insisted on seeing him in a very human way--filled with greatness, yet flawed like all of us. It's a memoir that reflects the best of Jackson: candid, honest and tellingly expressed."--Stanley Kutler, <em>Los Angeles Times</em><p></p><br>"Barrett has done an admirable and even heroic job, partly by interpolating some of Jackson's other writing, including unpublished materials and excerpts from an oral history, in which Jackson answered detailed questions about his life and his career. As a result, there is now a genuine book, one that contains some illuminating discussion of historical events. Most important, the book offers a fresh occasion for considering the personality and career of the greatest leader of the twentieth century, memorably described by Isaiah Berlin as the only statesman in the world upon whom 'no cloud rested.'"--Cass Sunstein, <em>New Republic</em><p></p><br>"<em>That Man</em> is a great find--the last memoir of Franklin D. Roosevelt by someone who worked with him and knew him well. Next to Oliver Wendell Holmes, Robert H. Jackson was the best writer on the Supreme Court in the 20th century, and his portrait of 'that man in the White House' is filled with astute insights and warm recollections. It is a book no fan of FDR can do without."--Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.<p></p><br>"These superbly eloquent chapters provide intimate glimpses of Roosevelt operating on many different levels. Through Jackson's informed lens, we are shown FDR as president, politician, lawyer, commander-in-chief, administrator, populist leader and companion. Jackson's account is not only of infinite value for the new light it sheds on 'that man,' but also for unique glimpses of Harold Ickes, Tommy 'The Cork' Corcoran, Harry Hopkins and the other New Deal stalwarts."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Franklin D. Roosevelt was the dominant political figure of the last century. Robert H. Jackson, Supreme Court Justice, was one of the essential figures in his life. Professor John Q. Barrett, a highly qualified authority on the subject, has now brought this relationship fully to light. I urge this volume for all who would know more of what could be the greatest days of Washington. I use the term cautiously: an indispensable book."--John Kenneth Galbraith<p></p><br>"Painstakingly, insightfully--even lovingly--assembled from notes and fragments found in a dusty closet belonging to Robert H. Jackson's recently deceased son, this remarkable and eminently readable volume--a newly available first-hand account of FDR as politician, lawyer, administrator, and commander in chief, written by an astute participant and brilliant observer who also happened to be the most piercingly eloquent writer ever to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court--will intrigue and inform anyone interested in the history of America's involvement in World War II or in the American presidency and the West Wing under FDR in an era a half century old that turns out to bear a surprising resemblance to our own."--Laurence H. Tribe, Ralph S. Tyler, Jr. Professor of Constitutional Law, Harvard Law School<p></p><br>"Intelligent, informed thoughts on FDR's presidency.... The intimate look into the way decisions were made brings Roosevelt very much into human focus."--<em>Kirkus Review</em><p></p><br>"A long lost gem has been unearthed after a half century. Supreme Court justice Robert Jackson's first hand portrait of Franklin Delano Roosevelt is as close as we are likely to get to deciphering the enigma that was FDR. Jackson, associate and friend, confidante and poker playing pal of the President, was perceptive enough to recognize the genius and honest enough to admit the flaws beneath his subject's seductive geniality. We are further indebted to the book's editor, John Q. Barrett, for rescuing this priceless memoir from an obscurity that would have left us poorer in our understanding of America's towering 20th Century statesman." --Joseph E.

The present volume represents Richard Courant&#39;s final revision of 1961.</p><p><p><b>Richard Courant</b> (1888-1972) obtained his doctorate at the University of G�ttingen in 1910. Here, he became Hilbert's assistant. He returned to G�ttingen to continue his research after World War I, and founded and headed the university's Mathematical Institute. In 1933, Courant left Germany for England, from whence he went on to the United States after a year. In 1936, he became a professor at the New York University. Here, he headed the Department of Mathematics and was Director of the Institute of Mathematical Sciences - which was subsequently renamed the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences. Among other things, Courant is well remembered for his achievement regarding the finite element method, which he set on a solid mathematical basis and which is nowadays the most important way to solve partial differential equations numerically.</p> <p><b>David Hilbert</b> (1862-1943) received his PhD from the University of K�nigsberg, Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) in 1884.

Hilbert is recognized as one of the most influential mathematicians of the 19th and early 20th centuries. His own discoveries alone would have given him that honour, yet it was his leadership in the field of mathematics throughout his later life that distinguishes him.

Simon Visiting Fellow in Religion &amp; Public Life in the James Madison Program at Princeton University.The first four verses of Hebrews form a single Greek sentence. By the end of the sentence,we have already been introduced to the theme of the superiority of the Son to angels, which will remain in focus throughout the rest of chs. 1--2.To impose a section break between vv.3 and 4 is therefore to favor a thematic analysis of the text over its grammatical form. My reason for doing so is that the contrast with the prophets with which the sentence opens (and which will not be made explicitly again in the rest of the letter) serves to set the scene more broadly than just in relation to angels and provides our author with the cue for his most powerful christological statement---indeed one of the three or four most striking accounts in the NT of the incarnate Son of God. The theme and indeed much of the language of vv.2--3 is closely parallel to what is said about the role of the Word/Son in creation and revelation in John 1:1--18 and especially Colossians 1:15--20.

Better Than the Prophets (1:1--3) Overview 1In the past God spoke to our forefathers through the prophets at many times and in various ways, 2but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed heir of all things, and through whom he made the universe. 3The Son is the radiance of God&#39;s glory and the exact representation of his being, sustaining all things by his powerful word.After he had provided purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty in heaven. Commentary 1--2a One of the chief glories of OT religion was its prophetic tradition. Israel lived not by human insight but by divine revelation as God &#39;spoke through the prophets.&#39; Our author has no wish to belittle this privilege, and he will quote from those same prophets later in the course of his argument. But now God has provided something even better. The prophets were many and varied, and their revelations came to the forefathers sporadically over a considerable period. But now their place has been taken by a single spokesman, whose message has been delivered once-for-all &#39;in these last days&#39; (lit., &#39;at the end of these days,&#39; echoing the OT formula &#39;in the end of the days,&#39; Ge 49:1; Isa 2:2; etc.).The period of preparation is over, and all that the prophets have looked forward to is now fulfilled in the single person of &#39;a Son.&#39; (The lack of article does not indicate one son among many but rather the true nature and status of this new spokesman as against his predecessors the prophets.) This title, which will form the backbone of Hebrews&#39; presentation of Jesus, is dramatically introduced in contrast with the mere messengers who have gone before and will immediately be filled out with a series of descriptive clauses that totally set him apart from all merely human representatives. Note that the name &#39;Jesus&#39; will not appear until 2:9, when the focus will be on the period of the human incarnation of the Son. In his essential nature he is better designated not by his human name but by a title that directly links him to God. 2b--3a Seven arresting statements now fill out the unique status of &#39;the Son&#39; and make it unmistakably clear he is much more than a passing historical figure like the prophets. The first five statements focus on his relationship to God and to the created universe in such a way as to place him outside the natural order as its originator and sustainer. Two further clauses in v.3b will then bring his historical work of redemption into focus, but first we are invited to contemplate the eternal glory of the Son since before the world was made. Three clauses trace the role of the Son in relation to the universe, covering respectively its past, present, and future. It was &#39;through&#39; the Son that God made the universe in the past; in the present that same Son upholds everything &#39;by his powerful word&#39;; and the future destiny of the universe is understood also in relation to him who has been made the &#39;heir of all things&#39; (perhaps echoing Ps 2:8; cf. the quotation of Ps 2:7 that follows in v.5). This is the same threefold relation to the creation, embracing all eternity, which is succinctly expressed in Paul&#39;s formula in Romans 11:36:&#39;from him and through him and to him are all things&#39;; Paul was speaking there of God, not of Christ, but in Colossians 1:16--17 he says the same of Christ:&#39;all things were created by him and for him . . . , and in him all things hold together.&#39;The author of Hebrews, like Paul (and John in 1:1--3), has no hesitation in saying of Jesus what in Jewish orthodoxy was reserved for God the Creator. The double clause that opens v.3 describes the Son&#39;s relation to God more directly and even more unequivocally, not now in his creative role but in his essential nature: he is &#39;the radiance of God&#39;s glory and the exact representation of his being.&#39; He is, in other words, as in John 1:14, 18, God made visible. To see what God is like we must look at the Son. &#39;Radiance&#39; (apaugasma,GK 575) means literally the &#39;outshining&#39; (though it is sometimes also used of a &#39;reflection&#39;) of the glory that is God&#39;s essential character, while &#39;exact representation&#39; translates the vivid Greek metaphor charakte rm , &#39;imprint, stamp&#39; (GK 5917), used, for instance, of the impression made on a coin, which exactly reproduces the design on the die. (The idea is the same as the more familiar phrase &#39;the image of God.&#39;) Again there is a close echo of Colossians 1:15, 19:&#39;He is the image of the invisible God. . . .God was pleased to have all his fullness dwell in him.&#39; 3b The glory of the Son consists not only in his eternal nature but also in his role in bringing salvation to human beings.The two clauses that conclude the description of the Son take up this theme and thus introduce two of the most prominent themes of the letter as a whole. First, he has &#39;provided purification for sins.&#39; The theme of the sacrificial work of Christ will come into focus especially in chs. 9--10 as the outworking of his office as our great high priest, where the author will emphasize that this work of purification is now fully complete.While at this point he does not yet spell out the means by which this &#39;purification&#39; has been achieved, his readers would be well aware that it must be through the shedding of blood (9:14, 22, etc.).The way is thus prepared for the paradoxical argument of ch. 2 that it is in his humiliation and death that the superior glory of the Son, as our perfect redeemer, is revealed. But humiliation is followed by exaltation, and the author&#39;s first allusion to Psalm 110:1 introduces the language of &#39;sitting at the right hand,&#39; which will echo through the letter (cf. 1:13; 8:1; 10:12; 12:2). The Son, his earthly work complete, now occupies in heaven the place of highest authority next to God himself.</p><h2>The Art of LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Programming (Full Color)</h2><p>With its colorful, block-based interface, The LEGO� MINDSTORMS� EV3 programming language is designed to allow anyone to program intelligent robots, but its powerful features can be intimidating at first. <i>The Art of LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Programming</i> is a full-color, beginner-friendly guide designed to bridge that gap.<br><br>Inside, you&#x2019;ll discover how to combine core EV3 elements like blocks, data wires, files, and variables to create sophisticated programs.

He learned to read and write at the village school and was prepared to follow his father's trade as a brazier when the English Civil War broke out in 1644 and he was drafted into the Parliamentary army. His military service brought him into contact with Oliver Cromwell's Puritan troops. Beginning in 1648, Bunyan suffered a crisis in religious faith that lasted for several years. He turned to the Nonconformist church in Bedford to sustain him during this period. His first writings were attacks against the Quakers. Then Charles II was restored to the throne and Bunyan was arrested for conducting services not in accordance with the Church of England. He spent 12 years in jail. During this time, he wrote his autobiography, Grace Abounding, in which he described his spiritual struggle and growth. During his last years in prison, Bunyan began his most famous work, The Pilgrim's Progress, a two-part allegorical tale of the character Christian and his journey to salvation. Part I was published in 1678 and Part II in 1684. The second part deals with the spiritual journey of Christian's wife and sons, as they follow in his footsteps. With its elements of the folktale tradition, The Pilgrim's Progress became popular immediately. Well into the nineteenth century it was a book known to almost every reader in England and New England, second in importance only to the Bible. Bunyan died in London on August 31, 1688.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>Pictures from an Institution: A Comedy (Phoenix Fiction)</h2><p><p>Beneath the unassuming surface of a progressive women&#x2019;s college lurks a world of intellectual pride and pomposity awaiting devastation by the pens of two brilliant and appalling wits. Randall Jarrell&#x2019;s classic novel was originally published to overwhelming critical acclaim in 1954, forging a new standard for campus satire&#x2014;and instantly yielding comparisons to Dorothy Parker&#x2019;s razor-sharp barbs. Like his fictional nemesis, Jarrell cuts through the earnest conversations at Benton College&#x2014;mischievously, but with mischief nowhere more wicked than when crusading against the vitriolic heroine herself. </p> <p>&#x201c;A most literate account of a group of most literate people by a writer of power. . . . A delight of true understanding.&#x201d;&#x2014;Wallace Stevens</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m greatly impressed by the real fun, the incisive satire, the closeness of observation, and in the end by a kind of sympathy and human warmth.

"Half the campus was designed by Bottom the Weaver, half by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe; Benton had been endowed with one to begin with, and had smiled and sweated and spoken for the other." The institution's star-struck head is a Clintonesque young man particularly adept at raising money in Hollywood and who "wanted you to like him, he wanted everybody to like him--it was part of being a president; but talking all the time was too." Unfortunately, his new creative-writing hire only likes him the first time they meet. Thenceforth, she not only stirs things up but skewers them as well. <p> When the book was first published in 1954, most considered Gertrude Johnson to be a none-too-veiled portrait of Mary McCarthy. (<i>The Partisan Review</i>, for instance, failed to run a planned excerpt for fear of litigation.) "As a writer Gertrude had one fault more radical than all the rest: she did not know--or rather, did not believe--what it was like to be a human being. She was one, intermittently, but while she wasn't she did not remember what it had felt like to be one; and her worse self distrusted her better too thoroughly to give it much share, ever, in what she said or wrote." <i>Pictures from an Institution</i> is a superb series of poisonous portraits, set pieces, and endlessly quotable put-downs.

Every day a new blaze seems to ignite: the bloody implosion of Iraq and Syria; the East-West standoff in Ukraine; abducted schoolgirls in Nigeria. Is there some thread tying these frightening international security crises together? In a riveting account that weaves history with fast-moving reportage and insider accounts from the Afghanistan war, Sarah Chayes identifies the unexpected link: corruption.</p><p>Since the late 1990s, corruption has reached such an extent that some governments resemble glorified criminal gangs, bent solely on their own enrichment. These kleptocrats drive indignant populations to extremes&#x2015;ranging from revolution to militant puritanical religion. Chayes plunges readers into some of the most venal environments on earth and examines what emerges: Afghans returning to the Taliban, Egyptians overthrowing the Mubarak government (but also redesigning Al-Qaeda), and Nigerians embracing both radical evangelical Christianity and the Islamist terror group Boko Haram. In many such places, rigid moral codes are put forth as an antidote to the collapse of public integrity.</p><p>The pattern, moreover, pervades history. Through deep archival research, Chayes reveals that canonical political thinkers such as John Locke and Machiavelli, as well as the great medieval Islamic statesman Nizam al-Mulk, all named corruption as a threat to the realm. In a thrilling argument connecting the Protestant Reformation to the Arab Spring, <em>Thieves of State</em> presents a powerful new way to understand global extremism. And it makes a compelling case that we must confront corruption, for it is a cause&#x2015;not a result&#x2015;of global instability.</p></p><p>Dear readers:<br>&nbsp;<br>Thanks very much for visiting this page, and for your interest in <i>Thieves of State</i>.&nbsp; I wrote this book to address a dumbfounding impasse: the inability of senior U.S. officials to make the connection between acute and abusive corruption and dramatic global upheavals, from the rise of violent extremism to the revolutions of the Arab Spring or Ukraine.&nbsp; What <i>Thieves of State</i> does is take you with me, so you can experience for yourself not just the abuse and humiliation of everyday corruption in many countries, but also the inner workings of the U.S. government as it reached a decision not to address the problem.<br><br>We'll also take a fascinating historical detour, for history has much to teach us about how people have grappled with these issues - and about how similar their responses have been across time and culture.&nbsp; We'll detail hard-nosed options for different approaches, and we'll take a glance in the mirror.<br>&nbsp;<br>It is an unusual book: no dry, expository policy-wonk analysis, rather a riveting story that will keep you engaged.&nbsp; But you'll also find plenty of thought-provoking, even sometimes provocative, analysis.&nbsp; I hope that you like it, and that you will let me know your thoughts either way.An Excerpt From<br><i><b>THIEVES OF STATE</b></i><br>by Sarah Chayes<br>Reprinted here with permission.<br><br>The question of pursuing a serious anticorruption policy was finally put to rest in January 2011.&nbsp; The battle was waged in the margins of an interagency document called "Objective 2015."&nbsp; It had occurred to someone that the U.S. government really ought to have a picture of what it was trying to achieve in Afghanistan - what the country would need to look like by the end of 2014 if it were to weather the withdrawal of international troops without imploding.<br>&nbsp;<br>The document was an embarrassment.&nbsp; Just the grammatical errors in the first paragraph made me flinch.&nbsp; Rather than identify true minimal requirements for Afghanistan to survive without international troops, it cut down ambitions to fit what was deemed "achievable" - whether or not such goals were sufficient to ensure Afghanistan could continue to exist.<br>&nbsp;<br>It seemed to me, for example, that for the Afghan government to last, motivations for joining the insurgency had to diminish.&nbsp; Afghans had better think more highly of their government by 2015 than they did in 2011.&nbsp; Yet in the document, the very modest goal of an upward trend in Afghans' confidence in their government was not listed as essential to mission success.&nbsp; It was considered only a "nice-to-have."<br>&nbsp;<br>The real anticorruption fight, however, was not over such fundamentals.&nbsp; It played out in the fine print of the document's "implementation guidelines."&nbsp; Over the furious dissent of mid-level Justice Department (DoJ) officials, seconded by the Joint Staff - but not by their own chief, Attorney General Eric Holder - the documents barred DoJ attorneys from mentoring anticorruption cases.&nbsp; They could do generalized capacity building, but they could not help shepherd specific cases against specific Afghan government officials.&nbsp; The investigations units, even if they were able to continue functioning, would never be able to bring a case to court.&nbsp; The courageous anticorruption prosecutors could never hope for backup from U.S. officials if they were intimidated, harassed, or demoted.<br>&nbsp;<br>The gavel had come down.&nbsp; By way of an apparently insignificant detail buried deep in an interagency document - a few words of guidance to DoJ attorneys - the U.S. decision to turn a blind eye to Afghan corruption was finally spelled out.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>NOT TILL the spring of 2013 did the penny drop as to what had prompted Petraeus's sudden change of heart in the summer of 2010 - and ultimately, what made the U.S. government shrink from addressing corruption in Afghanistan.&nbsp; On April 28, Matthew Rosenberg of the New York Times reported that the CIA had been paying millions of dollars per year, in cash, to President Karzai.&nbsp; Toward the end of his article was the nugget of information that told the whole story.<br>&nbsp;<br>The CIA's bagman was Muhammad Zia Salehi - that aide to Karzai who had been arrested, and then quickly released, in the summer of 2010.&nbsp; U.S. officials had walked into a circular firing squad.&nbsp; Salehi, the subject of the U.S. government's corruption&nbsp; test case, was also the U.S. government's intermediary for cash payments to Karzai.&nbsp; The choice of this target may have been deliberate - an effort to flush out into the open the profound contradiction at the heart of U.S. policy.<br>&nbsp;<br>Two senior U.S. officials told me later that throughout the investigation of Salehi, the planning for the arrest, and his liberation within a few hours, CIA personnel had remained silent about their relationship with him.&nbsp; Even afterward, despite strong words at Principals' Committee meetings and that Joint Staff "top twenty" list, the CIA never provided the U.S. ambassador or the key cabinet secretaries with the names of the Afghans it was paying.&nbsp; The station chief in Kabul continued to hold private meetings with Karzai, with no other U.S. officials present.<br>&nbsp;<br>In other words, a secret CIA agenda - which involved enabling the very summit of Afghanistan's kleptocracy - was in direct conflict with the anticorruption agenda.&nbsp; And with no one explicitly arbitrating this contradiction, the CIA's agenda won out.<br>&nbsp;<br>After those first few weeks in command, Petraeus veered hard away from governance efforts and devoted himself to targeted killing, which he intensified considerably.&nbsp; Targeted killing of individual terrorist suspects is the special domain of the CIA, which Petraeus left Kabul to run - until his tenure there was cut short by an extramarital affair that had germinated in the Yellow Building at ISAF headquarters.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Obama Administration, sickened by the cost in lives and resources that the counterinsurgency approach was exacting, and perhaps uncomfortable with the power and discretion that large-scale military operations place in the hands of the brass, turned increasingly toward special operations and drone warfare to counter security threats.&nbsp; Targeted, technologically advanced, secretive killing, over which the president had direct control, increased after 2010, spreading to Yemen and other theaters.<br>&nbsp;<br>But the point officials missed in making this shift - and in letting the priorities generated by this strategy trump governance objectives - is that targeted killings still represent a military response to a problem that is fundamentally political and economic in nature: a problem that is rooted in the conduct of government.&nbsp; The current U.S. approach sends a message, wittingly or not, to people who are often driven to violence by the abusively corrupt practices of their ruling cliques, and by frustration at seeing their legitimate grievance systematically ignored.&nbsp; The message seems to be: your grievances are, in fact, of no account.&nbsp; They will not be heard.</p><h2>Return of the Strong Gods: Nationalism, Populism, and the Future of the West</h2><p>After the staggering slaughter of back-to-back world wars, the West embraced the ideal of the &#x201c;open society.&#x201d; The promise: By liberating ourselves from the old attachments to nation, clan, and religion that had fueled centuries of violence, we could build a prosperous world without borders, freed from dogmas and managed by experts.<br> <br>But the populism and nationalism that are upending politics in America and Europe are a sign that after three generations, the postwar consensus is breaking down. With compelling insight, R. R. Reno argues that we are witnessing the return of the &#x201c;strong gods&#x201d;&#x2014;the powerful loyalties that bind men to their homeland and to one another.<br> <br>Reacting to the calamitous first half of the twentieth century, our political, cultural, and financial elites promoted open borders, open markets, and open minds. But this never-ending project of openness has hardened into a set of anti-dogmatic dogmas which destroy the social solidarity rooted in family, faith, and nation. While they worry about the return of fascism, our societies are dissolving.<br> <br>But man will not tolerate social dissolution indefinitely. He longs to be part of a &#x201c;we&#x201d;&#x2014;the fruit of shared loves&#x2014;which gives his life meaning. The strong gods will return, Reno warns, in one form or another. Our task is to attend to those that, appealing to our reason as well as our hearts, inspire the best of our traditions. Otherwise, we shall invite the darker gods whose return our open society was intended to forestall.</p><p><b>R. R.

The dictionary provides wide-ranging and lively coverage of not only Western philosophical traditions, but also themes from Chinese, Indian, Islamic, and Jewish philosophy. This clear and easy to use reference also contains in-depth analysis of philosophical terms and concepts, and a chronology of philosophical events stretching from 10,000 BC to the present day.</p><p><br><strong>Simon Blackburn</strong> is Edna J. Koury Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the University of North Carolina. He was a fellow and Tutor at Pembroke College, Oxford from 1969 to 1990. The author of <em>Spreading the Word</em> (1984) and <em>Essays in Quasi-Realism</em>, he edited the journal <em>Mind</em> from 1984 to 1990.<br>In his preface to the first edition, reprinted here, the author states that his "own interests and assessments are not always disguised." This is true of the second edition as well, providing such delicious morsels as, in the entry on Jacques Derrida, "Derrida's work . . . is not easily assimilated by people used to normal expressions of thought." Nevertheless, the vast majority of entries are admirably objective. Blackburn's preference is for--and expertise lies in--the branch of the Western philosophical tradition culminating in academic Anglo-American philosophy. <p>Although the book jacket claims this to be a "vastly expanded second edition, with over 500 new entries," there is no indication in the new preface or elsewhere what these new entries are. The page count has not altered significantly from the first edition. More than 500 of the new edition's more than 3,000 entries are biographical, including non-Western thinkers such as Confucius and Kitaro Nishida and nonphilosophers such as Dante and Freud. Among the terms covered are <i>Apathy, Capitalism, Environmental ethics, Hedonism, Hatha-yoga, Taoism, Ontology, Self-deception, Turing machine, Vedanta, Whig view of history,</i> and <i>Welfare.</i> Entries range in length from a sentence (e.g., <i>Formal implication, Free variable</i>) to nearly two pages (e.g., <i>Kant, Immanuel</i>). There is extensive cross-referencing within and between the lucid entries. Concluding the volume are an appendix of logical symbols and a chronology of important philosophical and other cultural dates.</p><p>The second edition's jacket quotes the <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> on the first edition: "the most comprehensive dictionary of philosophy in English." This is no longer true and was perhaps untrue even in 1996. In the last 10 years, a variety of excellent -single-author and multiple-author one-volume philosophical dictionaries, encyclopedias, and "companions" have become available (not to mention far more extensive print and Internet references). Each offers entries and viewpoints not found in any of the others so it makes good sense to have more than one. <i>The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy</i> is an excellent choice for public and academic libraries. <i>Craig Bunch</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Anoma Kani�e's Les Hommes Invisibles, Francois Truffaut, Le D�ejeuner de Sylvie, Marcel Pagnol's Au Parc Bor�ely avec tante Rose, and Colette's Dans la Foule: Apr�es L'Affaire de las Rue Ordener. <b> </b> For those interested in developing their reading ability in French. </p></p><p><p> <i>L'Art de Lire</i> introduces advanced beginner and intermediate students of French to nine fictional stories that cover a varied and enticing array of themes. It employs pre- and post-reading activities and vocabulary and grammar reviews to help students develop basic knowledge, strategies, and techniques for reading French. <i>L'Art de Lire,</i> now in its third edition, delivers a winning combination of inviting stories and a proven pedagogical approach that promises to bring students to a higher level of knowledge and enjoyment. </p><p> L'Art de Lire may be used at any level after the first year of French with students who have had little previous reading experience. Used in a course that focuses on the development of reading skills, or as a secondary text/reader in mufti-skilled course, it provides ample opportunities to learn to read French. The Third Edition retains the student-friendly format of the First and Second Editions and develops further student activities and investigations in and around the stories. We are grateful to our students and to our fellow teachers for their continued comments and suggestions. Many readers have appreciated the stories in L'Art de Lire, finding them to be intriguing or funny, moving or exciting. Stories are graded in difficulty; earlier readings are abridged and edited to make them more accessible. The number of cuts diminishes as the book progresses. Many selections are divided into a series of installments. All chapters are supported by a pedagogical apparatus that is both full and flexible. </p><p> The Pr�paration � la lecture starts with a concern for Lexique and highlights words in the context of explicit previews of the action. Through the first nine story segments, lexical categories distinguish Mots apparent�s and Faux amis. Afterwards, these categories are presented together with other Vocabulaire. Grammaire sections include demonstrations of Mots-cl�s, function words that also provide discourse coherence. Grammar is presented to provide a focus of recognition needed for reading comprehension. L'art de lire sections present succinct discussions and contextual illustrations of broad and specific reading knowledge and techniques on matters of vocabulary, grammar, culture, and the coherence of story. The Exercises that conclude each Pr�paration � la lecture consolidate command of the vocabulary presented. They are intended to help the student prepare for the reading. This work on lexical awareness serves the kind of knowledge that helps students recognize and understand words in different contexts. </p><p> Marginal questions in French provide a convenient and rapid way of reviewing the reading selection in class and should help students find their way through difficult passages on their own. Following each selection, Activit�s sur le r�cit review, and ensure grasp, and recall of details at the levels of action, character, place, and theme. A range of activity types are employed including true/false and sentence-completion exercises; others call for identification of characters, actions, places, or objects from the story. Activities are presented in narrative order and are sufficiently detailed to cover all of the significant action of the reading. While they may look like exam questions, their purpose is to recirculate the narrative material and relevant vocabulary in order to ensure that students are able to remember and deal with the story on their own terms in French. Students should be encouraged to write out answers fully in order to practice perceiving details of the written language. The Sujets de discussion, de composition, de recherche, et de pr�sentation encourage more critical responses. They bring the vocabulary of the story into more active use, invite students to think about meanings, and provide a framework in which they can discuss in French what pleases, bothers, or puzzles them about it&#x2014;the motivation of the characters, the plausibility of the plot, the relationship to their own lives, and so forth. Here, what students talk about and write is encouraged to become some sort of composition. Many of these exercises encourage role-playing activities, monologues and dialogues, to help students develop dramatic aspects of the story in the classroom. These exercises provide guidance for class discussion and writing activities, short analyses and essays, to work out some critical responses to the texts. While numerous suggestions for specific assignments are given (e.g. "pour une discussion en classe et un petit essai �crit"), these are to be taken as possible assignments following the teacher's curriculum and the student's needs. Class discussion and review with these exercises can help develop interest in the stories in different ways, dramatic and intellectual, cultural and personal. </p><p> In this part as well, students are asked to explore information that goes beyond the text (A la recherche). Here, students will be encouraged to locate on their own visual materials, maps or pictures, and other cultural information referred to in the text selections. Responsibility for learning to read starts with the student's commitment. L'Art de Lire should serve teachers and students of the language with the means to engage, observe, help with, and account for processes of reading and learning to read. Most of the exercises in Pr�eparations and in Activit�s are lettered and numbered so that a key can be established. Some exercises may be usable for evaluation purposes. Part of instruction is helping students keep their own accounts. </p><p> We'd like to thank several people for their contributions to this third edition of L'Art de Lire: Estelle Needleman and the people at PEDG for their project management and composition; Lisa Donovan for the interior design; and Kiwi Design for their work on the cover design. </p><p> Finally, we would like to acknowledge the following reviewers for their participation in the revision process: Barry Jean Ancelet, University of Louisiana at Lafayette; Dominique Duvert, Ohio University; Kirsten Halting, Southern Arkansas University; and Florence Martin, Goucher College. <br></p></p><h2>The Atom Station</h2><p>When the Americans make an offer to buy land in Iceland to build a NATO airbase after World War II, a storm of protest is provoked throughout the country. The airbase provides Laxness with the catalyst for his astonishing and powerful satire. Narrated by a country girl from the north, the novel follows her experiences after she takes up employment as a maid in the house of her Member of Parliament. Marvelling at the customs and behaviour of the people around her, she emerges as the one obstinate reality in a world of unreality. Her observations and experiences expose the bourgeois society of the south as rootless and shallow and in stark contrast to the age-old culture of the solid and less fanciful north. A witty and moving satire on politics and politicians, Communists and anti-Communists, phoney culture fiends, big business and all the pretensions of authority, Laxness&#39; masterpiece of social commentary is as relevant today as when it was written in 1948.</p><p>HALLDOR LAXNESS (1902-98) was born near Reykjavik, Iceland.

The high plateau that forms Morningside Heights is geographically isolated within the city and remained largely undeveloped even as neighboring Harlem and the Upper West Side became prestigious residential communities. At the end of the nineteenth century, institutions relocated to the plateau where sizable plots were available at a convenient distance from the built-up city. In 1887 Episcopal Bishop Henry Potter announced plans for the construction of a great cathedral at the edge of the plateau. The cathedral was soon followed by Columbia College and St. Luke's Hospital, which contemplated grand complexes, and by newer institutions such as Barnard College and Teachers College that were intent on establishing a presence in the rapidly growing city. Thus, Morningside Heights became indelibly associated with New York's educational, medical, and religious foundations, and was appropriately dubbed "the Acropolis of New York."<br><br>In this extensively illustrated book, Andrew S. Dolkart explores the architecturally varied complexes built by these organizations. He traces the successes and failures of each building project, as trustees and supporters struggled to raise funds in order to construct great campuses in a city where residents were not always generous in their support of such endeavors. Commissioning designs from some of city's and the nation's leading architects, the Morningside Heights institutions created a richly diverse ensemble of buildings.<br><br>The book tells the stories of the excitement surrounding the initial plans for an Episcopal cathedral and the ultimate failure of this grandiose project; the efforts of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to build a rival nondenominational church (Riverside Church); the development of Charles McKim's inspired designs for Columbia's campus; the efforts of Barnard and Teachers College to build impressive campuses adjacent to Columbia; and the later projects of Union and Jewish theological seminaries and the Institute of Musical Art (late the Julliard School) to erect buildings that would be part of the larger institutional concentration, but world provide each with a unique architectural identity.<br><br>Dolkart also traces the history of the surrounding residential neighborhood, providing the first comprehensive analysis of the design and construction the early-twentieth-century speculative apartment houses that typify so many New York neighborhoods. Based on extensive research and incorporating more than 200 photographs, <i>Morningside Heights</i> will appeal to anyone interested in architecture, urban development, or the history of New York City, as well as those associated with the neighborhood or its institutions.</p><p>The book tells the stories of the excitement surrounding the initial plans for an Episcopal cathedral and the ultimate failure of this grandiose project; the efforts of John D. Rockefeller, Jr. to build a rival nondenominational church (Riverside Church); the development of Charles McKim&#39;s inspired designs for Columbia&#39;s campus; the efforts of Barnard and Teachers College to build impressive campuses adjacent to Columbia; and the later projects of Union and Jewish theological seminaries and the Institute of Musical Art (late the Juilliard School) to erect buildings that would be part of the larger institutional concentration, but world provide each with a unique architectural identity.The announcement during the final years of the nineteenth century that the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Columbia College, St. Luke&#39;s Hospital, Teachers College, and Barnard College would construct new complexes on Morningside Heights heralded the transformation of this geographically isolated area into &#34;the Acropolis of New York&#34;. Over the next several decades, these institutions, as well as Union Theological Seminary, Jewish Theological Seminary, the Institute of Musical Art/Julliard School of Music, and Riverside Church created a neighborhood of spectacular institutional buildings. In this lavishly illustrated book, Andrew S. Dolkart explores the richly varied architecture and history of these complexes and of the surrounding residential neighborhood and thus reveals a fascinating chapter in the life of New York City.</p><h2>Border Crossings: A Bedford Spotlight Reader</h2><p>Delving into questions like, "What are borders?" and "Who are border crossers?", <em>Border Crossings</em> breaks down the complex issue through an extensive variety of readings and activities to really get you thinking and evaluating this theme. <br><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Magic Power of White Witchcraft Revised</h2><p>Offering helpful skills and techniques for such things as raising vital energy levels and influencing others to do your bidding, this text on white witchcraft provides rituals to achieve love, power, money and success.</p><p>Gavin Frost, Ph.D., D.D., and Yvonne Frost, D.D., remain the world&#39;s most acclaimed Witches.

The ordinary seaman is Esteban, a 19-year-old veteran of the war in Nicaragua, who has come to America with 14 other men to form the crew of the Urus. Docked on a desolate Brooklyn pier, the Urus is a wreck, and the men, without the means to return home, become its prisoners. Esteban, haunted by the loss of his first love in the war, gradually works up the courage to escape the ship and start a new life in the city. His story and those of his shipmates come to life, illuminating the conflicts and triumphs of the human heart.</p><p>Corey Snow, a full-time audiobook narrator and voice actor living in the great Pacific Northwest, has been everything from a paratrooper to a software developer. Working from his studio in Olympia, Washington, he has recorded numerous audiobooks, including&#34;Lak&#34;DeChance Chronicles. Corey&#39;s love of reading and storytelling shows in every word, regardless of whether he is bringing characters from a novel to life, clearly detailing military history, or making software theory rivetingGoldman's acclaimed debut, The Long Night of the White Chickens (1992), proves to have been no fluke: Its successor is an equally compelling saga of a crew of poor, would-be Central American sailors stranded aboard the rat-infested hulk of a dead ship. Esteban, a 19-year-old survivor of a Sandinista battalion shot to pieces in a contra ambush, flies to New York as part of a group of hopeful, desperate strangers hoping to take seamens' berths on the cargo ship Urus. On arrival, the crew is shocked to see their vessel stripped and sagging along an abandoned Brooklyn pier, its engine room a blackened disaster from a fire at sea on its last voyage. Despite appearances, the yanqui Captain and his non- Spanish-speaking mate are insistent that the Urus will be rebuilt, and they quickly set the crew to work. Summer fades into chilly fall, however, and it becomes obvious to the seamen that not only will the ship never become seaworthy, but they will never be paid; with no cash and no legal status, they're trapped in a floating nightmare. Already ill-clothed and -fed, their despair proves as numbing as the autumn winds, until Esteban begins to explore the area's warehouses, bringing back whatever he can steal. His forays lead him to a Latino neighborhood, where he finds sympathy, a job, and even a girl. He helps the others as best he can, insisting that a friend suffering from a bad burn be taken to the hospital (and he is, never to be heard from again); and when the crew's plight finally attracts official notice, Esteban again takes matters into his own hands. A bizarre set of circumstances (inspired by a true story) vividly wrought, but even more memorable is Goldman's fresh and moving take on such matters as longing, love, cruelty, and fellowship, probed in a poignant and original narrative.

In the southern Andes during the last century and a half of colonial rule, when the Spanish crown was losing its grip on the Americas and Amerindian groups began organizing into activist and increasingly violent political movements, a style of architectural sculpture emerged that remains one of the most vigorous and creative outcomes of the meeting of two cultures. The Andean Hybrid Baroque (also known as "Mestizo Style"), was a flourishing school of carving distinguished by its virtuoso combination of European late Renaissance and Baroque forms with Andean sacred and profane symbolism, some of it originating in the pre-Hispanic era. The Andean Hybrid Baroque found its genesis and most comprehensive iconographical expression in the architecture of Catholic churches, chapels, cloisters, and conventual buildings. Drawing on hundreds of primary documents and on ethno-historical and anthropological literature that has rarely been applied to an art-historical subject, Gauvin Alexander Bailey provides the most substantial study of colonial Peruvian architecture in decades. The product of five years of photographic surveys in Peru, Bolivia, and Argentina, as well as research in governmental and ecclesiastical archives in Latin America and Europe, Bailey's richly illustrated study examines the construction history and decoration of forty-four churches. It offers a fundamentally new understanding of the chronology, regional variations, and diffusion of the Andean Hybrid Baroque style, as well as a fresh interpretation of its relationship to indigenous Andean culture.</p> <p>"Gauvin Alexander Bailey's <i>The Andean Hybrid Baroque</i> is a magnificent and ambitious study that not only covers an important geographic area of the southern Andes but also encompasses, in an informative and ordered style, a complex and dense constellation of pre-Hispanic and European cultural references in constant change." --Ram�n Mujica Pinilla, Universidad de San Marcos, Lima, Peru</p> <p>"Gauvin Alexander Bailey's new book will surely become a textbook and standard resource for Andean art and architecture. With exciting insights into the colonial period in the southern Andes for the avid reader, and with original archival research for the inquisitive scholar, The Andean Hybrid Baroque challenges many of the facile suppositions about the indigenous and European cultural encounter and religious worldview. The author examines church facades in Peru and Bolivia, dating and scrutinizing the detailed carving work of native artists and combining that visual information with the testimony of colonial historians, inquisition records, and the images on textiles and queros (drinking cups). The result is an original and nuanced contribution to Andean scholarship." --Jaime Lara, University of Notre Dame</p></p><p>Gauvin Alexander Bailey is professor of Renaissance and Baroque Art, King&#39;s College, University of Aberdeen.</p><h2>Project Management Metrics, KPIs, and Dashboards: A Guide to Measuring and Monitoring Project Performance</h2><p><p>Essential strategies from Harold Kerzner on measuring project management performance</p> <p>The maze-like path of today's projects reflects a business environment that's growing in complexity.

His <i>Crisis of the Early Italian Renaissance</i> has provoked more discussion and inspired more research than any other twentieth-century study of the Italian Renaissance.</p><p>Baron's book was the first historical synthesis of politics and humanism at that momentous critical juncture when Italy passed from medievalism to the thought of the Renaissance. Baron, unlike his peers, married culture and politics; he contended that to truly understand the Renaissance one must understand the rise of humanism within the political context of the day. This marked a significant departure for the field and one that changed the direction of Renaissance studies. Moreover, Baron's book was one of the first major attempts of any sort to ground intellectual history in a fully realized historical context and thus stands at the very origins of the interdisciplinary approach that is now the core of Renaissance studies.</p><p>Baron's analysis of the forces that changed life and thought in fifteenth-century Italy was widely reviewed domestically and internationally, and scholars quickly noted that the book "will henceforth be the starting point for any general discussion of the early Renaissance." The <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> called it "a model of the kind of intensive study on which all understanding of cultural process must rest." First published in 1955 in two volumes, the work was reissued in a one-volume Princeton edition in 1966.</p></p><p></p><h2>Murderous Schemes: An Anthology of Classic Detective Stories</h2><p>These 32 classic crime stories illuminate the genre&#39;s best-known plot constructions--including the locked room, the caper, hoist on their own petards, and over the edge. Covering over 150 years of crime and detective fiction, featuring styles from the hard-boiled to the cozy, Murderous Schemes profiles the writing of Agatha Christie, Ellery Queen, Rex Stout, Dorothy L. Sayers, Edgar Allan Poe, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and many others.</p><p>When plotting a murder (figuratively speaking), the mystery writer has at hand any number of M.O.&#39;s including such tried and true conventions as the locked room, the unbreakable alibi, the double bluff, the mistaken identity, and many others. Indeed, one of the challenges (and greatest sources of pleasure) for a mystery writer is to visit a well-known plot construction - to try their hand at &#34;the locked room&#34; or &#34;the caper&#34; - perhaps to honor a writer or story they admire, perhaps to try to top them. Now, in Murderous Schemes, renowned mystery writer Donald E. Westlake and J. Madison Davis (current president of the International Association of Crime Writers) offer an illuminating look at eight such mystery conventions, illustrating each with four short stories written by some of the masters of the form. The resulting collection of thirty-two tales spans a hundred and fifty years of crime fiction and includes virtually every style imaginable, from the hard-boiled detective story to the cozy armchair mystery.About the Editors:<br>Donald E. Westlake is an acclaimed mystery writer. He received the Mystery Writers of America Edgar Award for his novel God Save the Mark and in 1993 won their Grandmaster Award for lifetime achievement. He was also nominated for an Academy Award for his screenplay for The Grifters. J. Madison<br>Davis is Professor of Journalism in the Professional Writing Program at the University of Oklahoma and is current president of the International Association of Crime Writers. He is the author of The Murder of Frau Schutz, which was nominated for the Edgar Award.</p><h2>Daniel: Faith Under Pressure (Bringing the Bible to Life)</h2><p><p>If you want to move from the biblical text to contemporary life on solid ground, this series has been written for you.
